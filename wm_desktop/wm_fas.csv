Sophie holds on a little too tight. Sits a little too stiff. And she sniffles during a chase scene, which is really the final straw.

Ryan has to tuck her head under Sophie’s chin to look up at her girlfriend. “It’s her loss, you know? I’m pretty damn amazing, and you? You’re Sophie freaking Moore, and anyone who chooses not to love you is making the worst mistake of their life.”

“What?”

“Seriously?”

“We’re 11 questions deep into our fourth round of 20 questions. And your last one was what age I learnt to swim. Let’s not pretend we haven’t been dragging the bottom of the barrel for a while now.”

Sophie huffed, not responding to Ryan for a moment. The sound of the drizzle on the roof of the van was the only thing piercing the silence.  Twenty questions had seemed like a good idea two hours ago when their coffee had long been nothing more than dregs at the bottom of their cups and there was still no sign of movement in the building they were staking out.

“It was ‘I’m Yours'.” Sophie said, her voice dropping, as though hoping Ryan wouldn’t hear.

But of course, she could never be so lucky. Ryan snorted in her nose, her head dropping onto the steering wheel, her shoulders shaking with laughter.

“Okay,” Sophie’s defenses went all the way up, “You don’t get to judge me for that.”

“You didn’t,” Ryan said.

“It was a popular song!”

“Girl, you did not have the white guy with an acoustic guitar song as your first dance.”

“Tyler choose it,” Sophie’s voice dropped, resignation seeping in. 

“Of course he did,” Ryan’s amusement was bright in her eyes and voice. “And you just went along with it.”

“Shockingly, for some reason, I wasn’t into planning my own wedding.”

“Yeah, I bet.” Ryan leaned back, tucking one foot under her on the seat so she could face Sophie.

I mean you were there when I told Ryan I don’t want to be included in her little sexcapades so maybe that’s why we haven’t heard from the two of them as of late.” Mary offered. Sophie was quiet. So Mary kept talking to fill the silence. “But Imani is cool, you’d like her.”

“I know Imani is cool Mary, she saved us from jail with her fancy lawyer knowledge. Besides, Ryan wouldn’t date somebody uncool. I mean except for Angelique.” Sophie said as an after thought.

“Ohhh you didn’t like her either!?” Mary exclaimed and put her hand on Sophie’s shoulder.” Mary laughed joyously. “Whew I thought I was the only one! Girl maybe we do need to get out the hard stuff from the cupboard!” She gave Sophie a look letting her know that she was down to turn up whenever she said the word.

“It’s not that I didn’t like her. She just wasn’t good enough for Ryan.” Sophie said matter-of-factly. Mary sat there in stunned silence at Sophie’s admission. But before she could say anything, Sophie tried to clarify.

“I-I just meant like she’s Ryan Wilder, bad ass extraordinaire, Batwoman by night and day, bartending babe on the side. Angelique was just bringing Ryan down. I never saw it until I got to know Ryan and realized she was always covering for Angelique, and Angelique was taking advantage of Ryan’s kindness and the emotional attachment that was there from when they were kids. Ryan felt like she owed Angelique, when really it was the other way around. Ryan’s a good person. She deserves someone who knows that but doesn’t use it against her, someone like-”

“Someone like you?” Mary offered up slowly, testing the waters.

“Are we singing Adele now?” Sophie went for a joke hoping that she was coming off as aloof. Mary just kept staring back at Sophie with a grin on her face.

“Stop smiling Mary. Ok what? If you’re thinking I want to date Ryan, I don’t.” Sophie inwardly cringed as this sounded like such a lie even to her own ears.

“Well it doesn’t sound like you want anyone else to have her.” Mary was feeling emboldened. Sophie didn’t seem mad, she just seemed either unaware or in denial. Mary continued, “you didn’t like Angelique, which I am with you on that one. And you sound jealous of Ryan spending time with Imani. So if all these girls that Ryan gets with upset you, then why don’t you just ask Ryan out? You just said she deserves better. You could be better.”","<p>&ldquo;Um I don&rsquo;t know actually now that you mention it.

Sophie Moore wakes up on her stomach. She notices that her face feels like she didn’t take off her make up. She pats her head and feels her braids so her wig must have come off or she took it off before crashing. Her head is definitely pounding a little bit. She feels comfortable besides the impending hangover but she knows this bed isn’t hers and this room smells like... Ryan? Sophie then notices the extra weight in the bed. She turns onto her side and comes face to face with a sleeping Ryan Wilder.","<p>Writer's Beginning Notes:</p>

<p>Sophie Moore wakes up on her stomach. She notices that her face feels like she didn&rsquo;t take off her make up. She pats her head and feels her braids so her wig must have come off or she took it off before crashing. Her head is definitely pounding a little bit. She feels comfortable besides the impending hangover but she knows this bed isn&rsquo;t hers and this room smells like... Ryan? Sophie then notices the extra weight in the bed. She turns onto her side and comes face to face with a sleeping Ryan Wilder.</p>","Write_as_it_rains","","Write_as_it_rains",1,"Devotion by Tone Stith","Silly Love Songs by Write_as_it_rains","<div><strong>Devotion by Tone Stith</strong></div><div>Silly Love Songs by Write_as_it_rains</div>",2021-07-09,"2b3y7M0vz0oqP5AwGguTV7","2b3y7M0vz0oqP5AwGguTV7?utm_source=generator",0,"https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d0000b273d7d23fdeabfbcd1ce73d0acd",0.593,0.842,1,-3.196,1,0.0347,0.027,"Played, Stage Directions","https://archiveofourown.org/works/32463067","2020-11-13","<a href=""https://archiveofourown.org/works/32463067"" target=""_blank""

Sophie breathed out a sigh too at the sudden change in topics and the loss of closeness that Ryan was providing. Had Ryan almost kissed her? Would Sophie have let her? Sophie got up and grabbed her dress pants and slipped them on. Then she turned her back and took off Ryan’s sleep shirt and put on her own top from the previous night that she found tossed over a chair. She could feel Ryan’s eyes on her and her face got hot. She turned towards Ryan once she had her own clothes on she saw Ryan quickly avert her gaze and then get up too. Ryan was wearing extremely short boy shorts and a top that barely fit; it was showing off her belly button ring. She also wasn’t wearing a bra and her nipples were poking hard against the fabric of the shirt. Fuck the only time this girl is covered is when she’s wearing the Batsuit. Sophie thought. She had to get out of this room. It was suddenly too hot, too cramped, and too Ryan.

“Ok well I’ll see you out there.” Sophie quickly went to open the door and hurried out.

The door shuts, and Ryan is alone with her thoughts.

Shame by Summer Walker starts playing:

In a perfect world

You're understanding, I'm not a perfect girl

I would drop my fears at the door

I would only bring myself and nothing more

And you let me be, a woman

And you let me be, a flawed woman

You would yearn to hear all about my past

What I've done, what I've did and why

Hear all my sick thoughts

And if I needed to, I could cry

And you would catch my tears

You don't wanna be nobody else's pain no, aye, no

You don't wanna be nobody else's place, to hide from themselves

[Chorus]

Shame

And I'm the one to blame

[Bridge]

You see right through me

You see through the smile

You see straight through me

You push past the lies, oh

You got it baby

Oh, oh, oh

She scrolls through Sophie’s Facebook, which Ryan admittedly leans a little closer to the screen to see. Sophie’s profile picture is still her Crows swearing in photo. “It’s been this way for years.

“You’re not,” Ryan says, but then it happens: the young Moore sisters perfectly reenact the final drill team performance from Cadet Kelly. “Not the dance from that gay ass Disney movie!” Ryan laughs.

"Bartender","T-Pain","Akon","","","T-Pain, Akon","I know you (even if you don't want me to)","Microphone feedback cuts off the rest of Sophie’s sentence. Jordan cheers from beside the DJ with a huge smile. “Next up, we’ve got a special song to celebrate Ryan’s return. This was requested anonymously.” Jordan dramatically and heavily turns to face where Ryan and Sophie are working. She sing-songs, “I wonder who it was.”
The opening notes of T-Pain’s ‘Bartender’ start playing. Most of the teens seem confused, but the chaperones all cheer and laugh. Sophie busies herself with glaring at Jordan. 
Ryan laughs. “You actually requested it?”
Sophie shrugs. “I mean, it is your song.” Not only is it appropriate for the night, but Ryan loves songs she can sing along to. She loves putting on a show, and Sophie can’t think of a better way to spend the night than watching Ryan actually have fun.
Ryan beams. Celeste fake vomits onto the bar. Ryan fake glares at Celeste.
“Just for that. You’re dancing with me.” Ryan walks around the bar to body-roll her way towards Celeste. The preteen groans and scrambles towards the other kids. “Wait up. It’s my song, didn’t you hear?”
Celeste rushes into the crowd, so Ryan turns her attention back towards Sophie. “Mission accomplished. She’s actually talking to people.”
Sure, the other kids might only be gossiping about the relationships of their instructors, but Celeste is talking to other kids instead of standing on the sidelines with the chaperones. When Sophie turns her eyes back to Ryan, Ryan has this gentle smile on her face. She blinks down some emotion in her eyes. Maybe it’s pride, or just empathy for the kids who don’t know where to be themselves.
“She’s doing better than me at her age,” Sophie admits. She leans her elbows into the bar, and the role reversal catches her off guard for a moment. Ryan glances over her shoulder at Sophie. How does she keep her curls like that? How does she look at Sophie like it’s the easiest thing in the world?
Ryan has to pitch up on her toes for a moment. She’s too close to Sophie over the bar counter as she snaps her fingers in a dramatic pout. “But here we are with no one to dance with.” She points to the ceiling as the bridge starts. “You ready? ‘Cause I can’t do this alone.” She sings, “‘She made us drinks, to drink. We drunk ‘em—’” She holds her clasped hand out to Sophie like a mic.

Sophie plays along and sings, “‘Got drunk.’”

Ryan pulls her mic back. “‘Man, I think she thinks I’m—’”

“‘Cooool.’”  

“‘She gave me a wink—’” And Ryan keeps singing, twirling on her toes with the ridiculous lights of the dance behind her. Her teasing voice over the autotune has never felt more true than this moment. She drops her fake mic to dance her way around the corner of their makeshift bar. By the time the chorus hits, she’s right in front of Sophie. Smile bright and so full of joy that Sophie can’t think of anything else.

Their eyes catch, as Ryan sings, “‘I like the baaaartender. Oooh, if you’re looking for meee.’” Her fingers graze Sophie’s, and sparks tingle all the way up Sophie’s arm. “‘I’m at the baaar with her.’” Sophie’s fingers tighten around Ryan’s automatically.

“‘I like the baaaartender. Oooh, if you’re looking for meee…’” Ryan’s voice trails, as Sophie gulps. As Sophie’s eyes widen and her pulse thrums in her ears, and she drops Ryan’s hand and steps back.
“I-I’ll be back.” And Sophie takes off out of there.","<p>Microphone feedback cuts off the rest of Sophie&rsquo;s sentence.

<p>The opening notes of <strong>T-Pain&rsquo;s&nbsp;</strong><em style=""font-weight: inherit;""><strong>&lsquo;Bartender&rsquo;</strong></em><em>&nbsp;</em>start playing. Most of the teens seem confused, but the chaperones all cheer and laugh. Sophie busies herself with glaring at Jordan.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ryan laughs. &ldquo;You actually requested it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sophie shrugs. &ldquo;I mean, it is your song.&rdquo; Not only is it appropriate for the night, but Ryan loves songs she can sing along to. She loves putting on a show, and Sophie can&rsquo;t think of a better way to spend the night than watching Ryan actually have fun.</p>
<p>Ryan beams. Celeste fake vomits onto the bar. Ryan fake glares at Celeste.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just for that. You&rsquo;re dancing with me.&rdquo; Ryan walks around the bar to body-roll her way towards Celeste. The preteen groans and scrambles towards the other kids. &ldquo;Wait up. It&rsquo;s my song, didn&rsquo;t you hear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Celeste rushes into the crowd, so Ryan turns her attention back towards Sophie. &ldquo;Mission accomplished. She&rsquo;s actually talking to people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sure, the other kids might only be gossiping about the relationships of their instructors, but Celeste is talking to other kids instead of standing on the sidelines with the chaperones. When Sophie turns her eyes back to Ryan, Ryan has this gentle smile on her face. She blinks down some emotion in her eyes. Maybe it&rsquo;s pride, or just empathy for the kids who don&rsquo;t know where to be themselves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s doing better than me at her age,&rdquo; Sophie admits. She leans her elbows into the bar, and the role reversal catches her off guard for a moment. Ryan glances over her shoulder at Sophie. How does she keep her curls like that? How does she look at Sophie like it&rsquo;s the easiest thing in the world?</p>
<p>Ryan has to pitch up on her toes for a moment. She&rsquo;s too close to Sophie over the bar counter as she snaps her fingers in a dramatic pout. &ldquo;But here we are with no one to dance with.&rdquo; She points to the ceiling as the bridge starts. &ldquo;You ready? &lsquo;Cause I can&rsquo;t do this alone.&rdquo; She sings, <strong>&ldquo;&lsquo;</strong><em style=""font-weight: inherit;""><strong>She made us drinks, to drink. We drunk &lsquo;em&mdash;&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp;</strong></em>She holds her clasped hand out to Sophie like a mic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sophie plays along and sings, <strong>&ldquo;&lsquo;</strong><em style=""font-weight: inherit;""><strong>Got drunk.&rsquo;</strong></em><em>&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ryan pulls her mic back.&nbsp;<em style=""font-weight: inherit;""><strong>&ldquo;&lsquo;Man, I think she thinks I&rsquo;m&mdash;&rsquo;&rdquo;</strong></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;</strong><em style=""font-weight: inherit;""><strong>&lsquo;Cooool.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp;</strong></em><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em style=""font-weight: inherit;""><strong>&ldquo;&lsquo;She gave me a wink&mdash;&rsquo;&rdquo;</strong></em><em>&nbsp;</em>And Ryan keeps singing, twirling on her toes with the ridiculous lights of the dance behind her. Her teasing voice over the autotune has never felt more true than this moment. She drops her fake mic to dance her way around the corner of their makeshift bar. By the time the chorus hits, she&rsquo;s right in front of Sophie. Smile bright and so full of joy that Sophie can&rsquo;t think of anything else.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Their eyes catch, as Ryan sings,&nbsp;<em style=""font-weight: inherit;""><strong>&ldquo;&lsquo;I like the baaaartender. Oooh, if you&rsquo;re looking for meee.&rsquo;&rdquo;</strong></em>&nbsp;Her fingers graze Sophie&rsquo;s, and sparks tingle all the way up Sophie&rsquo;s arm.&nbsp;<em style=""font-weight: inherit;""><strong>&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m at the baaar with her.&rsquo;&rdquo;</strong></em>&nbsp;Sophie&rsquo;s fingers tighten around Ryan&rsquo;s automatically.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em style=""font-weight: inherit;""><strong>&ldquo;&lsquo;I like the baaaartender. Oooh, if you&rsquo;re looking for meee&hellip;&rsquo;&rdquo;</strong></em><em>&nbsp;</em>Ryan&rsquo;s voice trails, as Sophie gulps. As Sophie&rsquo;s eyes widen and her pulse thrums in her ears, and she drops Ryan&rsquo;s hand and steps back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I-I&rsquo;ll be back.&rdquo; And Sophie takes off out of there.</p>","youngerdrgrey","","youngerdrgrey",7,"Bartender by T-Pain, Akon","I know you (even if you don't want me to) by youngerdrgrey","<div><strong>Bartender by T-Pain, Akon</strong></div><div>I know you (even if you don't want me to) by youngerdrgrey</div>",2021-09-06,"1RGIjMFMgJxkZHMDXVYzOJ","1RGIjMFMgJxkZHMDXVYzOJ?utm_source=generator",0,"https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d0000b273baf2f329d4feeb19761eddf4",0.832,0.391,8,-8.504,1,0.0628,0.0564,"Played, Prom, Party, Gathering","https://archiveofourown.org/works/31758931/chapters/83828863","2007-06-05","<a href=""https://archiveofourown.org/works/31758931/chapters/83828863"" target=""_blank""

"Have Mercy","Chlöe","","","","Chlöe","Wildmoore 4 times +1","Writer's Beginning Notes: 

Song used: 'Have Mercy' by Chloe Bailey (https://youtu.be/HW_pgXZIlN8)

...

  “Why don’t you get it set up? I’m going to text Ryan to see if she needs any help getting the food.”




Sophie nodded and headed towards her dvd shelf. She thanked her over-organized ass for making finding anything a breeze. And as if the universe heard Mary; the doorbell rang. 




        “It’s me,” the trio hear Ryan say through the door.




        “Nevermind. I’ll get it.” Mary put her phone down, hopped off the couch and pranced over to the door. 




So maybe Sophie looked in the mirror on the wall and ran her hand through her hair to make sure it was in place. So maybe she adjusted her sweater. And maybe she checked her makeup. It had nothing to do with Ryan finally making it to the party. Nothing at all. 




𝆕𝆕Murda on the beat so it’s not nice𝆕𝆕




Mary opened the door to a smiling Ryan holding four boxes of pizza and a bag of what looked like wings just as the song started to play from the speakers.




𝆕𝆕Booty so big lord have mercy𝆕𝆕




        “Oh damn. That’s my shit.” Ryan yelled as she walked into the apartment and started dancing to the music. Realizing the timing of the song with Ryan entrance, Sophie snapped her head around so fast and glared at Jordan.




        ‘Seriously?’ she mouthed. Jordan just shrugged and stepped away from the speakers.




        “I just hit shuffle. It was a coincidence. Scout’s honor.”




        “You were never a fucking girl scout.” Sophie whispered through gritted teeth. “I know what you’re doing. Stop it.”

Jordan ignored her and went back scrolling through the playlist on her phone. Sophie tried to focus on locating the movies on her shelf and not on Ryan, who had set the food down on the coffee table, throwing it back with her sister right behind her. Tried being the word because of course there was a mirror on the wall in front of her. So she was absolutely not looking at the way Ryan wound her hips while she sang the verses with a carefree sensuality that only Ryan could possess. 




She most certainly was not watching Ryan’s ass bounce in the black jeans she was wearing for the night. 




Wait.




What movies was she looking for again?




Oh right. Mean Girls. Eventually Sophie found the dvds, grabbed them and returned to the couch just in time to see the finale of what had become a mini grinding line of the other three. Ryan in front with Mary dancing behind her and Jordan maintaining the rear.  




As she watched, Sophie could admit to herself that she was attracted to Ryan. She wasn't blind. Ryan was fine as hell. With that thousand watt smile, those beautiful brown eyes, that amazing body. But she could never let Jordan in on it because she would never let her live it down. She already got enough teasing about them being “the perfect material for an enemies to lovers story”. 




       “Come on Soph. Dance with us.” Mary said, pointing in front of Ryan who was too busy feeling the music to notice the exchange. 




Sophie swallowed at the thought. And all of a sudden the room felt ten degrees hotter.




        “Um, nah. Imma pass. Grind lines aren’t really my thing. And especially not with my baby sister involved.” Sophie answered, taking a big swig of her beer to take her eyes off of Ryan dancing.




        “Fine.” Jordan stepped away, reached around Mary, grabbed Ryan’s hand and just as the intro to the next song started; pushed Ryan towards Sophie on the couch. “You dance with Ryan alone then. I got Mary.”





Sophie quickly hopped up in time to prevent Ryan from falling onto her on the couch but did so by awkwardly catching her around the waist. ","<p>Writer's Beginning Notes:&nbsp;</p>

"Touch Me","Victoria Monét","Kehlani","","","Victoria Monét, Kehlani","Distractions","Ryan offers a sad smile at the woman and pulls her closer to her, “You know I am having a nice time with you, but I am not feeling it.”

The woman looks at Ryan, confused, “What do you mean?”

Ryan nods her head over towards the table where Sophie is sitting with Renee. The woman looked over towards the table and then back at Ryan, “Oh.”

She looks back at Ryan with a sexy smirk. “I get it. But maybe I can help you forget about her.”

Ryan smirks back at the woman, “Maybe you can.”

As if almost on cue, Touch Me by Victoria Monet and Kehlani starts to play. The woman pulls Ryan close once more and begins to move her body against Ryan’s. Ryan can feel the woman’s hands slide down her back and to her ass. Ryan smiles and grinds her hips against her. As she continues to dance with the beautiful woman, she can suddenly feel a pair of eyes burning onto her. She looks around the club and sees Sophie staring at them. Ryan takes a moment to stare back at her before she turns back towards the woman.

Ryan leans in close to the woman's ear and whispers, “I didn't catch your name.”

The woman smiles and whispers back, “It's Selena.”

Ryan smiles at the woman and nods her head, “I'm Ryan.”

Selena smiles at Ryan and leans in to kiss her softly on the lips. Ryan kisses back and pulls Selena closer to her.

Didn’t take you for the basic type. This is how trust works, right? I give, you give? We come to expect it?

Just like that

Would you see a Ludacris gif if I send it? Does the burner have those capabilities?

Okay, cool, Sophie isn’t upset. She’s cracking Ludacris jokes. They’re still good. Ryan can push a little then.

 

Unknown to SM
Idk. Maybe try a different type of picture first.

...

“If I hear that ‘All I Want for Christmas is You’ shit play one more gotdamn time!”

“ANISSA!” Iris lunges forward, “TOUCH MY PHONE AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS.”

Ryan watches as Anissa uses her long arms to her advantage, grabbing the phone out of its AUX chord and playing a game of keep away that would be mean if it wasn’t so funny. Sophie, forever trying to ignore them, continues hanging stretched cotton balls that look like snow to the beams of the Hold Up. Alex and Kelly are supposed to be helping, but have used the now fifth Iris-Anissa Music Battle Royale as an excuse to reach behind the bar and pour drinks.

They started this tradition five years ago now, closing down the Hold Up for a night in December that’s just the crew. It started when Ryan and Alex first got to know each other teamed up on a mission. It doesn’t take long for gays to clock gays and before Ryan knew it, Alex already had her number in her phone and a promise for a double date in their future. Kelly and Sophie became best friends right away, sharing weekly Saturday morning FaceTimes. Anissa’s been the homie ever since Ryan met her the first time years ago at a Ladies Night in Freeland back when she first got of Blackgate. Of course with Anissa, came Grace. And Iris? Iris first got introduced to Anissa via her dad? Maybe? Ryan’s not too clear, but she knows that nothing makes Anissa happier than pissing Iris off on purpose, and that’s how they ended up back at the AUX chord battles.

Just in time, Grace reappears with Christmas lights wrapped around her arms. Ryan smiles to herself as Sophie sighs, relieved that at least someone is staying on task. Ryan gets up from her seat and goes to help her girlfriend, grabbing some extra cotton. She’s not sure what Grace whispers in Anissa’s ear, but it’s enough for her to relent the phone back to its rightful owner. 

“You play too much,” Iris hisses, but she’s smiling triumphantly. “And Just! For! That!”

Iris taps her screen and everyone groans as the familiar opening chimes start echoing through the speakers, followed by Mariah’s warm hum of the first notes.

“You know you love it.” Iris damn near skips (oooh she’d hate that description) over to Alex to take a glass of Bailey’s.","<p>Story Title: <strong>All I Want for Christmas Is You</strong></p>

You wouldn’t even know that Gotham had this many black people if it wasn’t for events like this. The Black joy and ease she sees warms her heart and is all she wants out of life. There are all types of Black people around but what really catches Jordan’s eye is all of the queer couples around.

They were so wrapped up, in the blankets and one another, that they didn’t even notice how cold out it was anymore. But they did notice when Christmas music started playing faintly in the background. As Leslie Odom Jr.’s “I’ll Be Home for Christmas” began playing, a lull in the conversation made it extra noticeable.

I’ll be home for Christmas

“God, where is that music coming from?” Sophie asked abruptly.

Ryan shot up and looked at her. “Okay, so you hear it too, right? It’s not just me?”

Sophie laughed and got up to look out over her balcony. “Ahh.” She motioned for Ryan to join her.

Below them was a couple making use of the condo’s outdoor area to have a series of slow dances.

Please have snow and mistletoe

“We should totally steal their flow, right?” Ryan proposed.

“We should what?” Sophie felt herself being pulled into Ryan’s arms.

Ryan beamed as she took Sophie’s arms and placed them around her neck. Naturally, they leaned their foreheads together.

Christmas Eve will find me

“By the way, you can stop pretending to hate all of my activities now. I know how much you love them,” she joked.

Sophie was quick with her rebuttal. “Do I? Or is that just what you’re telling yourself so that you can get me into another onesie?”

“Now, how did you know I had another one?” Ryan said in a way that left Sophie wondering if she was joking or not.

If only in my dreams

They eased back into silence and swayed in each other’s arms.

Some time through the trumpet solo, Ryan spoke softly to her partner, “You know, I know you said you were fine and I’m going to take your word for it.”

“But?”

“But I’m also just going to say that if your parents want to cut you out of the family because of their own bigoted beliefs, that’s their problem; not yours. If you being gay is an issue for them and they don't want to get to know you— the truest, most authentic, and beautiful version of you, it's their loss.”

Sophie found her mouth etching itself into a sad smile hearing her words from months ago parroted back to her.

“My time as Batwoman has taught me a lot about family. If someone is all the family you have, they're all the family you need. You have Jordan, Luke, Mary, and you have me. We’re going to do everything that the rest of them couldn’t; accept you and support you and love you. You know why?”

Smirking, Sophie knew what she was going to say next. “Why?”

“Because you still deserve it. I’m going to make every Christmas for you as magical as this one. And the magic I can't bring will find you. I know it will.”

Then, Sophie kissed her, in part because she loved her and in part to shut her up before she started blubbering like a baby on Ryan’s shoulders.

Christmas Eve will find me

As the song approached its end, Sophie felt something cold on her cheek. Actually, a few somethings in quick succession. She opened her eyes to see snow cascading swiftly onto their faces and all around them. “Did you know it was supposed to snow tonight?”

Ryan looked up and cheesed again. She laid her head on Sophie’s chest. “I told you, it finds the people who deserve it.”

“What finds its way?”

“Christmas magic.”

She queues up a throwback from her childhood and dances her way to the shower, reciting the lyrics in that almost corny way she does as the water heats…




🎶 I was layin' in the coup with my hat turned back

Was she acting like a lovesick teenager at 31? Perhaps. But if you can’t enjoy the high of new love, then what even is the point of anything?

She steps out of the shower smiling ear to ear, thinking about last night and the joy it brings her heart. She towels off still humming, pops a french vanilla in the keurig, and throws on a sundress because yeah she’s feeling sundressy!

That is…until she opens the doors to the balcony and remembers it’s fall, nearing winter, in Gotham. She promptly changes into a cute sweater, warm pants, and a sensible boot, chuckling to herself as she sips her cappuccino.

She knew that next week they’d be doing this dance and she could use that to distract Sophie. To get Sophie’s attention she gently placed her hand on Sophie’s arm and leaned in, saying “Tell me your critique of this. I can use tonight to learn.”","<p>A hush fell over the crowd as Vesper Fairchild, the show&rsquo;s host stepped out onto the stage. The recording indicator lights strategically placed out of camera lines but easy for the crowd to see flashed bright red. Then, Vesper said in her well known news anchor voice, &ldquo;Welcome to this season of Dancing With The Stars!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the first time Ryan got a look at the judges in person as Vesper welcomed them all back for yet another season. Renee Montoya was the hardest of the three to impress, so any compliments from her would be hard earned, Joe West was known to be the most softhearted and encouraging of the judges, Ryan wasn&rsquo;t so worried about him and Gideon was exceedingly fair and real stickler for the rules. She&rsquo;d seen Sophie consulting rule manuals a lot, and as a new pro she also suspected Sophie would be extra risk averse. So she wasn&rsquo;t worried about getting docked points from Gideon due to rule transgressions.</p>
<p>While the package for the night&rsquo;s first couple, a famous model named Ocean and his pro whose name Ryan hadn&rsquo;t caught yet, aired Ryan noticed Sophie was being all jittery again. As the announcer echoed through the ballroom, &ldquo;Dancing the Cha-Cha-Cha to <strong>Butter by BTS</strong>, Ocean and Lana&rdquo;, inspiration struck Ryan.</p>
<p>She knew that next week they&rsquo;d be doing this dance and she could use that to distract Sophie. To get Sophie&rsquo;s attention she gently placed her hand on Sophie&rsquo;s arm and leaned in, saying &ldquo;Tell me your critique of this. I can use tonight to learn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sophie leaned back, a slow smile spreading on her face. Ryan knew she had struck gold when Sophie moved her chair around, so instead of sitting a foot or so from Ryan they were right next to each other. Then she proceeded lean in close so she could narrate the entire dance to Ryan without being drowned out by the music. Having a job to do, something to focus on other than her nerves, had definitely calmed Sophie down.</p>","jump_the_gunn","","jump_the_gunn",1,"Butter by BTS, Megan Thee Stallion","and everyday I’m learning about you (the things that no one else sees) by jump_the_gunn","<div><strong>Butter by BTS, Megan Thee Stallion</strong></div><div>and everyday I’m learning about you (the things that no one else sees) by jump_the_gunn</div>",2022-01-05,"474VqnPDr0251lsQBB8sQB","474VqnPDr0251lsQBB8sQB?utm_source=generator",0,"https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d0000b2731b254e12b4ec7e6c565f735f",0.739,0.588,8,-4.971,1,0.136,0.00308,"Dancing, Dancing Competion","https://archiveofourown.org/works/36229327/chapters/90313060","2021-08-27","<a href=""https://archiveofourown.org/works/36229327/chapters/90313060"" target=""_blank""

Then, the announcer’s voice rang out, “Dancing the Quickstep to Woman by Doja Cat, Ryan and Sophie”","<p>Ryan shook her head. &ldquo;You might be the pro at dancing, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean you can&rsquo;t be a bit worried about the cameras and being on TV.&rdquo; Ryan said, knowing she was deliberately downplaying the reason Sophie was nervous. She wasn&rsquo;t sure Sophie would want to burden Ryan&rsquo;s learning experience with her career worries.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks Ryan&rdquo;, was all Sophie was able to reply before they heard the cue. Ryan dropped Sophie&rsquo;s hand and they walked out onto the stage. The replay of their comments, about Ryan&rsquo;s career, both of them saying how much dancing in a same sex couple meant to them played on screens throughout the ballroom. Then, the announcer&rsquo;s voice rang out, &ldquo;Dancing the Quickstep to<strong> Woman by Doja Cat</strong>, Ryan and Sophie&rdquo;</p>
<p>The beat of the song dropped in a few seconds later. Sophie had prepared her well, before she could think her body started to move of it&rsquo;s own accord to the beat. She felt, rather than saw Sophie completing the side by side steps that started the routine. Then, as the chorus ended and the rap verse started, she joined Sophie in ballroom hold. The dance was frantic, although their upper bodies stayed still their feet were moving at warp speed across the floor dancing in double time to the beat of the song. The routine ended as planned, they faced each other with their arms outstretched. Sophie looked radiant, and Ryan could feel herself beaming back at her. Whatever else happened now, they&rsquo;d danced together in front of America, normalizing two women being together.</p>

Sophie tries to brave her face when Ryan finally makes her way back to the cave, but Ryan sees herself in the reflection of the worried crinkles at the corner of her eyes. That’s the thing about having a girlfriend — there’s no place to hide. Maybe Ryan was willing to convince herself that it wasn’t as bad as it looked, that a few scrapes and bruises are a price well paid to protect the city’s most vulnerable. But there was no convincing Sophie.
After debriefing with Luke and having Mary clean up dried blood and check for any broken bones or concussion (none, thank God), Ryan lets Sophie help her back to their apartment. This has become their tradition. When the night is done and the city is finally quiet, Ryan is never alone. She has her girl. She has this one place where she can be vulnerable, where she doesn’t have to take care of everyone else before she takes care of herself.
 Ryan protects Gotham. Sophie protects Ryan. That is their way.
Sophie eases Ryan onto the couch and helps her out of her Vans, rubbing her feet slightly as she goes.
“I cannot believe you never told me about “Touch Me”! You know I love Kehlani! AND VICTORIA MONET! And yet, here I am having to learn about this two year old song from Anissa in the group chat!! The group chat, Ryan? What’s the point of this relationship if you aren’t going to help in my lesbian education?”
Ryan chuckles, slightly kicking Sophie off of her with her left foot. She knows Sophie is doing this on purpose, trying to keep it light. But after a night like tonight, her energy is fading. Her skin is tender, turning purple in places as bruises form. And a faint laugh? That’s all she got.

Writer's Beginning Notes:

just a bunch of Ryan and Sophie being very attracted to each other because “Woman” by Doja Cat is a great song with some absurd lyrics. Press play and just vibe.

Let's all say that Ryan and Sophie are new girlfriends, okay?

...

There’s something about the beat of this damn song. Something sensual and inviting that builds as Doja sings, “let me be your woman.” Good music always makes the shifts go by faster. Makes a quick pop over to the booths for glasses feel like the start of a music video.

Ryan dances along, her hips swaying, eyes slightly hooded as her tongue pokes out between her teeth. She spins to play into her little video girl fantasy. But on the spin, she spots Sophie on the edge of the section. Sophie’s eyes snap up to meet Ryan’s. Ryan laughs. Leave it to Sophie to be dead serious at the bar.

Ryan turns back to the table to get the glasses. Short legs and arms means she bends over it to get some of the farther ones. She could’ve walked around, but she knows Sophie’s still watching.

A hand lands on Ryan’s swaying hip for just a moment. Ryan freezes at the touch, but relaxes once she glances over her shoulder to see that it's Sophie. They’re still new to this — the touches that don’t have to be innocent, the heated glances that get to burn forever.","<p>Story Title: <strong>let me be your woman</strong></p>

The music came on and Sophie gladly moved from her mark towards Ryan. The start of the routine progressed exactly as plan, Ryan keeping her timing in sync with Sophie’s even as they danced in parallel. They progressed to a sequence where they were dancing in hold and Sophie could see Ryan’s thinking face as they neared the most tricky part of the routine, the split dip. As choreographed, Sophie spun Ryan back into her, so that her back was flush with Sophie’s front. Taking advantage of being so close that Ryan would be able to hear her Sophie instructed, “Ryan, relax”, in the split second they had before she lowered Ryan between her own legs and into the splits. As she pulled Ryan up and got back into hold for the next few bars she could hear the crowd applauding and saw the tension leave Ryan. 

The transition back to side by side movement was marked by a high kick, Sophie smiling genuinely as she saw Ryan successfully complete the kick in her periphery. The dance was all hip action and longing glances as the energy of the song overtook them. Sophie knew the chemistry would be palpable onscreen. The finale of the dance ended with them in hold, their bodies pressed close as the camera panned out.

Taking advantage of being so close that Ryan would be able to hear her Sophie instructed, &ldquo;Ryan, relax&rdquo;, in the split second they had before she lowered Ryan between her own legs and into the splits. As she pulled Ryan up and got back into hold for the next few bars she could hear the crowd applauding and saw the tension leave Ryan.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The transition back to side by side movement was marked by a high kick, Sophie smiling genuinely as she saw Ryan successfully complete the kick in her periphery. The dance was all hip action and longing glances as the energy of the song overtook them. Sophie knew the chemistry would be palpable onscreen. The finale of the dance ended with them in hold, their bodies pressed close as the camera panned out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sophie pulled Ryan into a hug before the moved towards the judges, saying, &ldquo;See I knew you would show that cha-cha.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ryan laughed and led Sophie over to the mark on the floor, holding her hand the whole way.</p>","jump_the_gunn","","jump_the_gunn",2,"Don't Cha by The Pussycat Dolls, Busta Rhymes","and everyday I’m learning about you (the things that no one else sees) by jump_the_gunn","<div><strong>Don't Cha by The Pussycat Dolls, Busta Rhymes</strong></div><div>and everyday I’m learning about you (the things that no one else sees) by jump_the_gunn</div>",2022-01-15,"1gZ7i4qxXkHZb1r6eioaAP","1gZ7i4qxXkHZb1r6eioaAP?utm_source=generator",0,"https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d0000b2738cc44129c3b11adec74058d6",0.88,0.637,1,-3.493,1,0.0893,0.0051,"Dancing, Dancing Competion","https://archiveofourown.org/works/36229327/chapters/90833053","2005-01-01","<a href=""https://archiveofourown.org/works/36229327/chapters/90833053"" target=""_blank""

Sophie would never tell Ryan this but she found it incredibly hot whenever Ryan was in the Batmobile. The sheer power and control that Ryan possessed when she was in that thing, the rev of the engine, the sexy sleek red and black of the car that matched Ryan's suit and the wig she wore. All of the lights and buttons in the car that seemed to know what Ryan needed and when she needed it. Sophie loved the few times that she got to be in the Batmobile riding shot gun with Ryan. The Batmobile was already a super fast car but Ryan definitely had a lead foot. She'd speed through the streets and swerve in between cars like she was on a longboard and Sophie loved every minute of it. She never felt scared because she trusted Ryan. 

""So, you gonna stare at me all night?"" Ryan said out of nowhere. She turned her head towards Sophie and gave her one of those thousand watt smiles of hers. 

""Oh please, don't be so full of yourself. I was just staring out in that direction and you just happen to be in my line of sight."" Sophie offered dumbly. Ryan chuckled. 

""Uh huh."" Ryan flipped on her playlist.

They should've treated you better
Girl they should've treated you better
They didn't show you enough love

You ain't even gotta tell, you know I got it

You feel like you deserve to be loved
Your exes did you wrong
That's why you stayed alone
But your lonely days are gone
I came out here to save you...

Sophie looked at one of the screens in the car to see what song was playing. ""Late night drive"" by someone named Yo Trane. Sophie got butterflies in her stomach.

"When Doves Cry","Prince","","","","Prince","and everyday I’m learning about you (the things that no one else sees)","They were standing posed under the intense spotlight, forehead to forehead, Ryan’s arms around the back of Sophie’s neck. Sophie’s arms holding Ryan’s waist, her fingers grazing Ryan’s skin since she’d been given a tiny backless dress this week.  They’d of course practiced the pose as the starting point of their dance. They never had to hold it so long though, as they waited for the recorded package to end. It felt kind of like a meditation to Ryan, especially when she felt Sophie’s thumb moving in small reassuring strokes.

Finally, the announcement sounded, “Dancing the Argentine tango to When Doves Cry by the Prince with her partner Sophie, it’s Ryan Wilder.” 

With the shriek of the electric guitar playing the opening riff of the song they were off. This dance was smooth and fluid, bodies passing between bodies. Legs always seemingly impossibly tangled to a viewer but actually playing a carefully choreographed back and forth. Things started to get real when they got to the first lift, Sophie grasped the back of Ryan’s neck and Ryan held onto her arms. Using Sophie for both momentum and leverage Ryan leaped up as high as she could, doing a scissor kick as she moved from one side of Sophie to the other. She landed smoothly and without any pause they continued on with the choreography, twisting back into hold for a few steps before Sophie split one of her legs through Ryan’s.

Ryan hadn’t forgotten what Sophie had said about being able to fake chemistry. And all week while they’d been practicing Ryan had felt a spark of chemistry. But the way Sophie was looking up at her now from between her legs, that girl deserved an Oscar. Even knowing it was fake Ryan, was overwhelmed by the intensity of it. This was easy to work with, it felt real for her. So when Ryan hooked her leg up around Sophie and moved in close, running her hand down Sophie’s neck and into the deep V of her costume, the passion was there. She felt it, she saw it and she knew this performance would be off the charts.","<p>They were standing posed under the intense spotlight, forehead to forehead, Ryan&rsquo;s arms around the back of Sophie&rsquo;s neck.

Writer's Beginning Notes:

Hi y’all, this is my first fanfic so please be nice. I really love Wildmoore and wish there was more content so I decided to try my hand. Also, this fic is kind of inspired by hell is where i dreamt of you and woke up alone by blackbear and also just Sophie’s conversation with Jordan about her dream. Hope you like it!

Oh also I’m on Twitter with the same handle slimthickmani, so follow me if you want to :)

...

Sophie looked up now, gazing into Ryan’s eyes before opening her mouth to speak. She cleared her throat so as to not choke on the words. Then quickly: “Ihadadreamaboutyou.” Ryan could barely decipher the sentence.

“You... had a dream about me?” Ryan repeated back to her, confused. Sophie drew in a long breath and looked down to her fingers again.

“Yeah, I- I had a dream about you. I was sick and you brought me soup and flowers,” Sophie looked up to gauge Ryan’s reaction. All she saw was a neutral, but intrigued face. She marched on. “And it was honestly a really good dream, having you there when I was sick. But then I woke up and you weren’t there, and it sucked. It felt like a special kind of Hell, to have dreamt of you and woke up alone.” Another exhale escaped Sophie’s lips as she geared up for her big finale. “Ryan, I really like you. And I think you like me, too. And I think you should let me take you on a date.”

At this, Ryan broke into a smile. And a giggle left her mouth. Sophie looked at her in bewilderment. She had just poured out her feelings and the girl was laughing? She felt like she could combust. “I thought you’d never ask,” Ryan said after she collected herself. She scooted a little bit closer to Sophie to place a soft, chaste kiss on the corner of her mouth. “I’d love to go out with you, Sophie. I’ve liked you for a while now.” Sophie smiled that shy smile reserved for Ryan and brought her in for the warmest hug.

“You dreamed about me, huh?” Ryan teased. “And not waking up next to me felt like Hell? Damn, I got it like that?”

Sophie groaned. “Shut up, Wilder. Don’t make me regret telling you that.”

“Too late,” the brunette quipped. “I’ll always hold that over your head.” She shifted in Sophie’s grasp, moving her head so she could look her in the eyes. “You can sleep next to me tonight. Maybe it’ll be like heaven instead when you wake up,” she added with a giggle. Sophie rolled her eyes super hard but couldn’t suppress the smile on her face knowing that Ryan was probably right.","<p>Story Title: <strong>hell is where i dreamt of you and woke up alone</strong></p>

Sophie rolled her eyes super hard but couldn&rsquo;t suppress the smile on her face knowing that Ryan was probably right.</p>","slimthickmani","","slimthickmani",1,"hell is where i dreamt of u and woke up alone by blackbear","hell is where i dreamt of you and woke up alone by slimthickmani","<div><strong>hell is where i dreamt of u and woke up alone by blackbear</strong></div><div>hell is where i dreamt of you and woke up alone by slimthickmani</div>",2022-01-23,"1PcU7Qy3VUgeYaByCThdm9","1PcU7Qy3VUgeYaByCThdm9?utm_source=generator",0,"https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d0000b2736c112ab47442b526755ffe36",0.588,0.199,7,-11.615,1,0.0573,0.924,"Story or Chapter Title, inspiration","https://archiveofourown.org/works/36606238","2017-04-21","<a href=""https://archiveofourown.org/works/36606238"" target=""_blank""

...

Writer's Beginning Notes:

I am currently a bit in love with the Emmy Meli song 'I Am Woman' and it makes me think of Javicia Leslie every time I listen to it so Happy Batwoman Day =)

...

Ryan doesn’t hear her feet pounding the pavement or her blood rushing to keep up the pace, nor does she feel the burn of a few minutes ago. As she rounds the corner onto their street and their building comes into view she’s almost tempted to run straight past, add on another kilometre or so. She’s absolutely buzzed, dopamine and endorphins bubbling away under her skin, encouraged by the rare Gotham sun and the music in her headphones. She feels like she could go for hours, maybe run the city perimeter, but Soph should be finishing work soon and they have dinner plans before tonights patrol. She takes the stairs up to their apartment two at a time, determined to actually be ready – showered and spectacular – for when Sophie gets home. Maybe hoping a little that she’ll look too good to share, that dinner will be skipped and her incredible dress stripped. She finally stops running when she reaches the door but she’s nowhere near ready to stop moving, to cut this song, now louder without all the street noise and making her feel euphoric.

I am woman, I am fearless

I am sexy, I am divine

 

Slamming the front door behind her, she squeezes her eyes closed, mouthing the lyrics enthusiastically before bouncing towards the kitchen and dropping her key onto the counter.




I am unbeatable, I am creative

Honey, you can get in line




The blender jug is upside down on the drainer and a huge delivery of oxytocin swells up to join the other feel goods – Sophie always remembers to wash it for her after her morning HIIT sessions and having someone think and do these little things just for her will never get old. Her singing lifts with her mood as she dances around the kitchen collecting the ingredients for her protein smoothie.




I am feminine, I am masculine

I am anything I want

I can teach you, I can love you

If you got it going on

 

She genuinely can’t think of a time she’s ever felt this happy, this alive. And she’s not even fazed by the level of cheese right now – she feels cute, might delete the thought from memory later. As a rule, Ryan tries really hard not to dwell on the unbalanced amount of shit life and its inhabitants have thrown at her because what’s the fucking point?

 

If you got it, got it, got it, got it, got it, got it

If you got it, got it, got it, got it, got it going on

 

She’s always kind of lived by the adage that you should throw out into the world what you hope to get back, so maybe that’s what this is. Maybe it’s finally happening.

 

Got it, got it, got it, got it, got it, got it, got it

If you got it, got it, got it, got it, got it going on

Got it on going on, ya

 

Not karma exactly…more like a manifestation of what she’d always hoped her life could be.

 

(Got it, got it, got it, got it, got it going on)

(Got it, got it, got it, got it, got it going on, yeah)




She has a home and a job and a cause and a girl, all her own.

 

 

I'm classy, I'm modern, I live by my own design

I'm cherry, I'm lemon, I'm the sweetest key lime pie

 

A meaning beyond what anyone or anything external had ever wanted to attribute to her.

 

I'm electric, I'm bass, I'm the beat of my own drum

I could make your goosebumps raise

With the tracing of my thumb

 

 

She has friends and a family, she has a city and she’s loved, truly, finally equal to the love her Mama gave and got in return. She’s not alone or ever scared that she’s going to be. Not anymore.

 

Only love can get inside me

I move in my own timing

Voice of the future speak to me kindly

I feel what I want and somehow it finds me

 

She did this. Now they all do this with her and for her and she feels…invincible.

 

 

Somehow it finds me

Somehow it finds me

Somehow it finds me

Yeah! Hey hey!

 

The sweat is drying on her skin but throwing herself around the kitchen and singing loudly (badly but so damn what?) is keeping the fire stoked inside. She kicks off her trainers, takes off skidding across the tiled floor like a kid to return the almond milk to the fridge. She cleans the remaining hempseed butter from her teaspoon with her mouth and then uses it as a microphone, belting out the words so even her own ears hear them through her headphones.

 

 

I am woman, I am fearless

I am sexy, I am divine

I am unbeatable, I am creative

Honey, you can get in line

I am feminine, I am masculine

I am anything I want

I can teach you, I can love you

If you got it going on

 

She presses the lid onto the blender and pulses her drink, hips tick-tocking staccato in perfect time, voice getting louder and louder to rise above the blades.

 

 

If you got it, got it, got it, got it, got it, got it

If you got it, got it, got it, got it, got it going on

Got it, got it, got it, got it, got it, got it, got it

If you got it, got it, got it, got it, got it going on

Got it on going on, ya

(Got it, got it, got it, got it, got it going on)

(Got it, got it, got it, got it, got it going on, yeah)

 

She pours the smoothie over ice and drops the jug into the sink, encouraged to turn the sound up even more when she hears it clang against the metal.

 

 

Hear no evil, speak no evil

I am not the one to curse

They can talk that shit about you

Long as you know that it's false

 

She’s so hyped right now she might burst. Full to the very brim with pure unadulterated goodness, energy vibrating in every atom of her being; she actually can’t still any part of herself long enough to function. Her smoothie can wait. The shower can wait. Her dress can wait. Right now she has no choice but to move. To sing, shriek, scream at the top of her voice as she throws herself further into their apartment. Hands above her head, ass going every which way, belly bar reflecting light across the walls as she passes through towards the bathroom.

 

I am earthly, I am heaven

I am what I like to be

When I ask for what I want

 

Somehow it finds me

Somehow it finds me

Yeah! Hey hey!

 

‘HEYYYY! Ohhhh crap.’




Sophie is twisted around in her seat at the dining table, one set of multiple pairs of eyes staring at her as she quickly drags the headphones down around her neck. Her heart beats in her throat – partly from almost jumping out of her skin at the unexpected company, but mostly from sheer embarrassment at the show she’d inadvertently just put on for what looked like the Mayor’s office, GCPD, Jordan’s outreach investors and a couple of B list celebs. And her extremely tense looking girlfriend.




‘Ryan,’ Soph grinds out, cheeks flushed and eyes imploringly wide. ‘Can you give us a few minutes to wrap this up please?’




‘Yep. Of course. Not a problem.’ She rushes back into the kitchen, necks the smoothie like it’s a half pint of Tequila just to stop herself from squirming or screaming or both.




‘Oh my God, Ryan,’ Sophie hurries into the kitchen, shaking her head. ‘What the hell was that?’




‘You said you were in a meeting until 5! I didn’t think anyone was here.’




‘I WAS in a meeting until 5! On Zoom, like the rest of the frikkin world!’




‘Well why didn’t you stop me?’




‘I tried!’ Sophie visibly softens, the ridiculousness of the situation dawning, and steps closer to Ryan to jostle the headphones. ‘You obviously couldn’t hear over these. And I couldn’t exactly get out of my chair and come in here because…’ She gestures down at herself and the half business suit half jami attire she’s rocking.




‘Ohhh, my bad.’ Ryan winces but with the hint of a grin. ‘Did I wreck the proposal?’




‘Not as much as you wrecked that song.’




‘Rude.’




Sophie steps fully into her pouting girlfriend, arms encircling to clasp together in her lower back.




‘Honestly, it was dragging on a bit – I think they were grateful for the show. It was quite the performance.’




‘I was in the zone.’ Ryan gazes up at her, scrunching her face all cute and playful. ‘Play your cards right and maybe you’ll get a private show later.’




‘Well it’s a widely known fact that everyone sounds better in the shower, and you my love are very much in need of one, so why don’t we do an undressed rehearsal right now?’




‘Hmm…’ Ryan hums against her lips, guiding her gently backwards in the general direction of the bathroom. ‘I’m gonna let that insult slide for now but better believe you’ll be paying for it later.’




‘Oh I’d say I’ve prepaid for that one given the way you just forced me to mix business with pleasure.’




‘Call it even?’

"The Most Beautiful Girl In the World","Prince","","","","Prince","A Weekend Escape","The drive to Philadelphia was a quick, thanks to Sophie’s bomb playlist. She finally gave Ryan an idea of what she had in mind, there wasn’t anything time restrictive so it would allow them to just go with the flow of the day and see how they felt. Ryan was excited about the idea of the Vegan food fest, but most of all, just getting to spend a few carefree days with her girl. When they reached their location, Sophie parked and they got out to start their exploration.

“I’m surprised some of this food doesn’t smell too bad. Let me find out you’ve been purposely torturing me with what you’ve been bringing to my place.” Sophie teased her.

Ryan rolled her eyes, nudging Sophie with her shoulder before she intertwined her fingers with Sophies. They held hands as they moved through the crowd. There were also vendors who were selling art here and there between the food vendors. Occasionally Ryan would steal glances at Sophie, secretly admiring her beautiful girlfriend.

"Intro","Ariana Grande","","","","Ariana Grande","Meet Me at the Altar","“Jordan said you were worried about your vows,” Ryan prompted, sifting her fingers through Sophie’s to hold her hand.

“It was a mess. She said it sounded more like an essay than vows and she was right. God, I don’t know why I thought I could do it,” Sophie explained, kicking herself in the process. Ryan squeezed her hand tighter.

“It’s alright, darling,” Ryan assured her. She shifted so she could see Sophie’s face. “How about we write them together? We do everything better together anyway.” 26 minutes. “I can start: I’ll give you all I have.”

Sophie considered the words, and a warm feeling entered her chest. She smiled for practically the first time that day. “And nothing less, I promise.” She paused, considering her wants, and her fears, and her desires. “Love me and don’t look back.” The words sounded almost desperate to her ears, but she couldn’t help it. She needed to say exactly how she was feeling if this was going to work.

“I want you with me,” Ryan squeezed her hands again, drawing their foreheads together, both of them closing their eyes on contact. “On this road to the sky.” Ryan felt in her core that her and Sophie would last forever. Even past the grave.

Sophie’s next line came out almost like a question. “We’ll be shining every night.” It was her way of saying that they’d never go to sleep mad at one another. Their love should cast over them as they lay their heads down to rest.

Ryan understood the request because she knew Sophie better than anyone else. “I promise you. Just me and you?” She agreed and came back with a question of her own.

“I promise you,” Sophie finished, their vows complete. She opened her eyes to see mahogany orbs already staring into hers.

“God, I love you so much, it’s almost scary,” they both laughed at Ryan’s confession, breaking apart. They sat in a silent embrace for a few more moments before Sophie moved to stand, pulling her wife-to-be with her. 18 minutes. “Ah,” Ryan said, looking down at her phone with a satisfied grin. “We’re gonna make it back with time to spare.”

...

As they approached the altar, Luke let them go, their signal to open their eyes for their first look. Instantly, they took in the other woman’s ensemble and gasped. Ryan was in an intricate, lacy dress with a long train, while Sophie opted for a long-sleeved silk dress with beaded detail along the waist. The pictures that would be sent to them after the ceremony of this moment, showed faces full of love and adoration and longing.

The women were giddy with delight as Jada started officiating. They could barely hear her because they were so focused on each other. She had to prompt them twice to get them out of their stupor for their vows. Like the first change in their ceremony, they decided to say their vows simultaneously. “I’ll give you all I have, and nothing less, I promise,” they started. “Love me and don’t look back. I want you with me on this road to the sky. We’ll be shining every night. I promise you, just me and you, I promise you.”

When they finished, there wasn’t a dry eye in the place. Tearfully, Jada announced, “I now pronounce you wives. You may kiss the bride.” As their lips entangled passionately, the bar erupted in applause. They could barely hold the kiss because they were so happy that they were laughing.

“Thank you for meeting me at the altar, my love,” Ryan said, still in her wife’s embrace.

“Just me and you, Ryan Wilder-Moore.”

Thank you Beth and Randall for the vows inspo, y'all are my fictional parents. Also, if you liked the vows themselves, thank Ariana Grande and Victoria Monet because they were very bigbrained for that.

*TW: mentions of s**cide in this fic*

Hello :)

So basically I was feeling like a soft boi and ended up writing this fic. I keep getting reminded of what Ryan said in episode 3x09, and although it may not happen on the show, I feel like it’s something Sophie would want to address again.. especially after they are an established couple. Because that was scary. I don’t think she would forget about it.

Anyways, here’s how I imagined that conversation might go.. title is a lyric from Kiana Lede’s song Protection, which makes me think of Ryan and Sophie heavily. I recommend you give the song a listen. Hope y’all enjoy :)","<p>Story Title: <strong>When I&rsquo;m Drowning</strong></p>

They had woken up around the same time, with the chirping of the birds and the rising of the sun, as daybreak hit their tired eyes. Ryan had pressed up against her from behind, her drowsy lips to the nape of Sophie’s neck as she breathed, “Hey, you,” against her skin.

...

Ooh, I'm breaking down. Whispers would deafen me now. You don't make a sound. Heartbreak was never so loud.

One day, months beforehand, Mary asked her if she believed in soulmates.

Her answer was 'no'. Nothing more, nothing less.

Not for a lack of trying, or even just wanting to. Because, believe her, she desperately wanted to and boy, had she tried. But odds had a nack for not being in her favor routinely.

She wasn't born a cynic. She had been raised that way.

Maybe if Angelique had stayed any of the 3567 times they had started something, she would have believed in soulmates.

Maybe if her biological mother hadn't abandoned her, and then her real mom hadn't been ripped from her cold, bloody fingers, she would have believed in soulmates.

Maybe if the first time she met her, handcuffs and two-way mirrors hadn't been involved, she would have believed in soulmates.

And maybe, just maybe, if she had sucked it up. Been a goddamn big girl for once and finally went for something, someone, she wanted, Ryan Wilder would have believed in soulmates.","<p>Story Title: <strong>whispers would deafen me now</strong></p>

...

Sophie tried to hide her blush with a slight shake of her head against the doorframe. She lifted her head and studied Ryan for a long moment which made Ryan a little uneasy. It almost felt like Sophie was looking through her, seeing all of her, and she thought that maybe Sophie had developed the gift of reading her just as well as she had with Sophie. Before she could ask what that look was for, Sophie pushed herself off the doorframe and walked over to the couch in 3 long strides and sat down taking Ryan’s hands in her own. “You need to rest too, Ryan. I know that you have so much going on right now and that you have all of that weighing down on your shoulders, but you’re also human. You need to sleep and rest.” Ryan was looking down at their hands until Sophie hooked her index finger under her chin and gently pulled up so that she would meet her eyes. Sophie’s eyes scanned between both of Ryan’s like she was gauging how to convince Ryan to try to go back to sleep. “Let’s just turn the world off for a little while.” Sophie’s voice was low and raspier than normal from sleep. How could Ryan deny her anything with that voice paired with those eyes. 




Ryan’s heart squeezed in her chest. Sophie was always there when she needed her. She was always willing to help. She always had Ryan’s back and she always knew what to say to get Ryan out of her head. Except that damn kiss in the woods, not that Ryan was complaining. She also knew that Sophie wouldn’t rest if she didn’t, but Ryan really couldn’t sleep right now. She was just waiting for the moment when Marquis decided to unleash his plan. But she had to take advantage of these moments of peace. Of this moment. With Sophie, here in the loft, wearing her clothes, holding her hand, and looking at her like THAT. A look so soft and caring, it made the backs of Ryan's eyes burn. She doesn't think that anyone has every looked at her the way Sophie looks at her. At that moment, an idea popped into her head. She wasn't going to be able to sleep but they both deserved a little escape from all of the chaos. She carefully pulled her hands out of Sophie’s and reached for her phone on the table. Sophie tiled her head again. Wordlessly, she waited patiently as Ryan clicked and scrolled and clicked again.




Ryan place her phone back down on the coffee table and looked up into Sophie’s beautifully, confused eyes as music started playing from her phone. Sophie glanced at Ryan’s phone and then back at Ryan, raising an eyebrow in silent question. Ryan smiled and stood up just as the lyrics started.




We can turn the world off

Forget about what’s goin’ on outside




Ryan held her hand out to Sophie who looked at her hand and then up at her, her face scrunched further in confusion.




We can make it all stop

Freeze a little time tonight




""Come here, Soph."" Ryan smiled down at her and bent slightly to grab both of Sophie’s hands to pull her up from the couch as Sophie narrowed her eyes at her.




Don’t need a DJ, a disco ball
No cover charge, no last call




Ryan pulled Sophie a little closer, giggling at Sophie’s slight, surprised gasp.




Just pull me close
And let’s see where this goes




She wrapped her left arm around Sophie’s waist, letting her left hand rest on the small of Sophie’s back. She had to tilt her head up to meet Sophie's eyes, which no longer held any confusion. Instead, there was a twinkle of surprise, followed by a moment of realization. And Ryan was thankful that she had developed this skill of knowing each and every one of Sophie's feelings just by looking into her eyes.




Turn the lights down low
Let’s take it slow




With her right hand, Ryan laced her fingers with Sophie’s left without breaking eye contact, unable to keep a smile from her face.




Dancing in the living room
Slow dancing in the living room




She felt Sophie’s other arm wrap around her waist with her hand resting her back. Ryan winked playfully at Sophie who chuckled as she turned her head slightly and cast her eyes down in an attempt to hide her blush. 




It’s just you and me in our bare feet
Dancing in the living room
Slow dancing in the living room




""Eyes on me, Agent Moore."" Ryan teased as she started swaying to the rhythm of the music, gently, leading Sophie side to side. 




We can put a record on
Spin me like the vinyl, ’round and ’round




Ryan took a small step back from Sophie with a bright smile and a sparkle in her eyes as she raised their linked hands so she could spin herself underneath their arms. There was no way she could reach up that high and spin Sophie especially in her bare feet. 


Pour the drinks and make ’em strong
Burn up every candle in this house




As she was finishing her turn, Sophie grabbed her by the waist with her free hand and pulled her back in close which made Ryan tilt her head back, giggling.




Turn the lights down low
Let’s take it slow




Ryan’s hand returned to its place on the small of Sophie’s back, as Sophie leaned in resting her forehead against hers.


Dancing in the living room
Slow dancing in the living room




Both of their eyes closed as they swayed in time with the slow beat.




It’s just you and me in our bare feet
Dancing in the living room
Slow dancing in the living room

Don’t need a DJ, a disco ball
If I got you, I got it all
Just pull me close




Sophie lifted her head tightened her grip on Ryan’s waist, pulling her impossibly close. 


And let’s see where this goes




This time, Sophie too the opportunity to quickly stepped back with a smirk and raised their linked hands and rotated her wrist to spin Ryan under their arms. Ryan's shock must have been evident on her face, because as she spun around to face Sophie again, she was met with a cocky, smug smile which Ryan returned with a light shake of her head and an eye roll for good measure. 




The lights down low
Let’s take it slow




Sophie pulled Ryan back in close, still swaying, as they got lost in each others’ brown eyes and soft smiles as the chorus plays again.


Dancing in the living room
Slow dancing in the living room




Sophie takes her hand and steps back slightly before pulling her hand up and twirling Ryan around once again before stepping back in close, grabbing her waist with one hand and dipping her backwards all in one smooth motion. Ryan gasps at the sudden movement. She lifts her head slightly and meets Sophie's light eyes, sparkling with amusement. Ryan bites down on her bottom lip in a feeble attempt not to smile. But it obviously didn't work. 




It’s just you and me in our bare feet
Dancing in the living room
Slow dancing in the living room

Sophie gently pulls Ryan up from the dip and continues swaying them as the song comes to an end. 

Dancing in the living room

Slow dancing in the living room

Slow dancing in the living room




The music fades but neither of them register the silence. Ryan unlaces their fingers to wrap both of her arms around Sophie's middle and leans in to rest her head against Sophie’s chest as she burrows her face into the space between her chin and shoulder. She feels one of Sophie's arms wrap around her back and the other hand cups the nape of her neck, as her cheek rests on the top of her head. Ryan lets out a deep sigh, like she's just released a breath that she's been holding for too long.  She listens to Sophie’s heartbeat, tuning out every other thought and sound, just breathing in and out, inhaling Sophie's scent.

She finally got out of her head, even if it was only for five minutes. No thoughts, no stress. Just her and Sophie. Sophie holding her impossibly close, as if she's trying to meld them together as one, as if she is trying to absorb all of Ryan's stress and worry if only for a few minutes. 




After a minute, Sophie seems to finally register that the music has stopped and she moves her head back slightly starting to pull away, until Ryan’s arms tighten around her waist.




Ryan isn't ready to let go yet. She just wants to hold Sophie a little while longer, to stay in this moment as long as she possibly can. “Wait, Soph. Can we just leave the world turned off for a little while longer?” Ryan's voice is so soft, as she mimics Sophie's words, almost desperate to stay in this little bubble of peace. Sophie smiles and kisses Ryan's hairline before returning her cheek to the top of her head and wrapping her arms tighter around Ryan's back. She releases a contented sigh and as Ryan closes her eyes, she swears she can feel Sophie smile against her hair. Surprisingly, her mind had abandoned all the worry and stress over Marquis, for now. Ryan's mind was finally quiet. Except for one loud thought: I am already in love with this woman.

Writer's End Notes:

Song is by Mickey Guyton: Dancing in the Living Room","<p>Story Title: <strong>Turn the World Off</strong></p>
<p>...</p>
<p class=""p2"">Sophie tried to hide her blush with a slight shake of her head against the doorframe. She lifted her head and studied Ryan for a long moment which made Ryan a little uneasy. It almost felt like Sophie was looking through her, seeing all of her, and she thought that maybe Sophie had developed the gift of reading her just as well as she had with Sophie. Before she could ask what that look was for, Sophie pushed herself off the doorframe and walked over to the couch in 3 long strides and sat down taking Ryan&rsquo;s hands in her own. &ldquo;You need to rest too, Ryan. I know that you have so much going on right now and that you have all of that weighing down on your shoulders, but you&rsquo;re also human. You need to sleep and rest.&rdquo; Ryan was looking down at their hands until Sophie hooked her index finger under her chin and gently pulled up so that she would meet her eyes. Sophie&rsquo;s eyes scanned between both of Ryan&rsquo;s like she was gauging how to convince Ryan to try to go back to sleep. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s just <strong>turn the world off </strong>for a little while.&rdquo; Sophie&rsquo;s voice was low and raspier than normal from sleep. How could Ryan deny her anything with that voice paired with those eyes.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""p3"">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""p2"">Ryan&rsquo;s heart squeezed in her chest. Sophie was always there when she needed her. She was always willing to help. She always had Ryan&rsquo;s back and she always knew what to say to get Ryan out of her head. Except that damn kiss in the woods, not that Ryan was complaining. She also knew that Sophie wouldn&rsquo;t rest if she didn&rsquo;t, but Ryan really couldn&rsquo;t sleep right now. She was just waiting for the moment when Marquis decided to unleash his plan. But she had to take advantage of these moments of peace. Of this moment. With Sophie, here in the loft, wearing her clothes, holding her hand, and looking at her like THAT. A look so soft and caring, it made the backs of Ryan's eyes burn. She doesn't think that anyone has every looked at her the way Sophie looks at her. At that moment, an idea popped into her head. She wasn't going to be able to sleep but they both deserved a little escape from all of the chaos. She carefully pulled her hands out of Sophie&rsquo;s and reached for her phone on the table. Sophie tiled her head again. Wordlessly, she waited patiently as Ryan clicked and scrolled and clicked again.</p>
<p class=""p3"">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""p2"">Ryan place her phone back down on the coffee table and looked up into Sophie&rsquo;s beautifully, confused eyes as music started playing from her phone. Sophie glanced at Ryan&rsquo;s phone and then back at Ryan, raising an eyebrow in silent question. Ryan smiled and stood up just as the lyrics started.</p>
<p class=""p3"">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""p2""><strong><em>We can turn the world off</em></strong></p>
<p class=""p2""><strong><em>Forget about what&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; on outside</em></strong></p>
<p class=""p3"">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""p2"">Ryan held her hand out to Sophie who looked at her hand and then up at her, her face scrunched further in confusion.</p>
<p class=""p3"">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""p2""><strong><em>We can make it all stop</em></strong></p>
<p class=""p2""><strong><em>Freeze a little time tonight</em></strong></p>
<p class=""p3"">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""p2"">""Come here, Soph."" Ryan smiled down at her and bent slightly to grab both of Sophie&rsquo;s hands to pull her up from the couch as Sophie narrowed her eyes at her.</p>
<p class=""p3"">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""p2""><strong><em>Don&rsquo;t need a DJ, a disco ball</em></strong><br /><strong><em>No cover charge, no last call</em></strong></p>
<p class=""p3"">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""p2"">Ryan pulled Sophie a little closer, giggling at Sophie&rsquo;s slight, surprised gasp.</p>
<p class=""p3"">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""p2""><strong><em>Just pull me close</em></strong><br /><strong><em>And let&rsquo;s see where this goes</em></strong></p>
<p class=""p3"">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""p2"">She wrapped her left arm around Sophie&rsquo;s waist, letting her left hand rest on the small of Sophie&rsquo;s back. She had to tilt her head up to meet Sophie's eyes, which no longer held any confusion. Instead, there was a twinkle of surprise, followed by a moment of realization. And Ryan was thankful that she had developed this skill of knowing each and every one of Sophie's feelings just by looking into her eyes.</p>
<p class=""p3"">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""p2""><strong><em>Turn the lights down low</em></strong><br /><strong><em>Let&rsquo;s take it slow</em></strong></p>
<p class=""p3"">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""p2"">With her right hand, Ryan laced her fingers with Sophie&rsquo;s left without breaking eye contact, unable to keep a smile from her face.</p>
<p class=""p3"">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""p2""><strong><em>Dancing in the living room</em></strong><br /><strong><em>Slow dancing in the living room</em></strong></p>
<p class=""p3"">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""p2"">She felt Sophie&rsquo;s other arm wrap around her waist with her hand resting her back. Ryan winked playfully at Sophie who chuckled as she turned her head slightly and cast her eyes down in an attempt to hide her blush.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""p3"">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""p2""><strong><em>It&rsquo;s just you and me in our bare feet</em></strong><br /><strong><em>Dancing in the living room</em></strong><br /><strong><em>Slow dancing in the living room</em></strong></p>
<p class=""p3"">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""p2"">""Eyes on me, Agent Moore."" Ryan teased as she started swaying to the rhythm of the music, gently, leading Sophie side to side.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""p3"">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""p2""><strong><em>We can put a record on</em></strong><br /><strong><em>Spin me like the vinyl, &rsquo;round and &rsquo;round</em></strong></p>
<p class=""p3"">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""p2"">Ryan took a small step back from Sophie with a bright smile and a sparkle in her eyes as she raised their linked hands so she could spin herself underneath their arms. There was no way she could reach up that high and spin Sophie especially in her bare feet.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""p2""><br /><strong><em>Pour the drinks and make &rsquo;em strong</em></strong><br /><strong><em>Burn up every candle in this house</em></strong></p>
<p class=""p3"">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""p2"">As she was finishing her turn, Sophie grabbed her by the waist with her free hand and pulled her back in close which made Ryan tilt her head back, giggling.</p>
<p class=""p3"">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""p2""><strong><em>Turn the lights down low</em></strong><br /><strong><em>Let&rsquo;s take it slow</em></strong></p>
<p class=""p3"">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""p2"">Ryan&rsquo;s hand returned to its place on the small of Sophie&rsquo;s back, as Sophie leaned in resting her forehead against hers.</p>
<p class=""p2""><br /><strong><em>Dancing in the living room</em></strong><br /><strong><em>Slow dancing in the living room</em></strong></p>
<p class=""p3"">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""p2"">Both of their eyes closed as they swayed in time with the slow beat.</p>
<p class=""p3"">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""p2""><strong><em>It&rsquo;s just you and me in our bare feet</em></strong><br /><strong><em>Dancing in the living room</em></strong><br /><strong><em>Slow dancing in the living room</em></strong></p>
<p class=""p2""><strong><em>Don&rsquo;t need a DJ, a disco ball</em></strong><br /><strong><em>If I got you, I got it all</em></strong><br /><strong><em>Just pull me close</em></strong></p>
<p class=""p3"">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""p2"">Sophie lifted her head tightened her grip on Ryan&rsquo;s waist, pulling her impossibly close.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""p2""><br /><strong><em>And let&rsquo;s see where this goes</em></strong></p>
<p class=""p2"">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""p2"">This time, Sophie too the opportunity to quickly stepped back with a smirk and raised their linked hands and rotated her wrist to spin Ryan under their arms. Ryan's shock must have been evident on her face, because as she spun around to face Sophie again, she was met with a cocky, smug smile which Ryan returned with a light shake of her head and an eye roll for good measure.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""p3"">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""p2""><strong><em>The lights down low</em></strong><br /><strong><em>Let&rsquo;s take it slow</em></strong></p>
<p class=""p3"">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""p2"">Sophie pulled Ryan back in close, still swaying, as they got lost in each others&rsquo; brown eyes and soft smiles as the chorus plays again.</p>
<p class=""p2""><br /><strong><em>Dancing in the living room</em></strong><br /><strong><em>Slow dancing in the living room</em></strong></p>
<p class=""p2"">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""p1"">Sophie takes her hand and steps back slightly before pulling her hand up and twirling Ryan around once again before stepping back in close, grabbing her waist with one hand and dipping her backwards all in one smooth motion. Ryan gasps at the sudden movement. She lifts her head slightly and meets Sophie's light eyes, sparkling with amusement. Ryan bites down on her bottom lip in a feeble attempt not to smile. But it obviously didn't work.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""p1"">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""p2""><strong><em>It&rsquo;s just you and me in our bare feet</em></strong><br /><strong><em>Dancing in the living room</em></strong><br /><strong><em>Slow dancing in the living room</em></strong></p>
<p class=""p2"">Sophie gently pulls Ryan up from the dip and continues swaying them as the song comes to an end.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""p2""><strong><em>Dancing in the living room</em></strong></p>
<p class=""p2""><strong><em>Slow dancing in the living room</em></strong></p>
<p class=""p2""><strong><em>Slow dancing in the living room</em></strong></p>
<p class=""p2"">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""p2"">The music fades but neither of them register the silence. Ryan unlaces their fingers to wrap both of her arms around Sophie's middle and leans in to rest her head against Sophie&rsquo;s chest as she burrows her face into the space between her chin and shoulder. She feels one of Sophie's arms wrap around her back and the other hand cups the nape of her neck, as her cheek rests on the top of her head.

<p>Morning after 3x11 with Sophie and Ryan. They deserve some much-needed rest. #LetRyanSleep2k22<br />*Yes, the title is inspired by <strong>the Mitski song</strong>*</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Sophie opens her eyes to the dark <strong>blue light</strong> of the early morning coming in through the windows of the loft. A quick glance at the clock on Ryan&rsquo;s nightstand tells her she&rsquo;s only slept for a couple of hours.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class=""Apple-converted-space"">...</span></p>
<p>Sophie moves her hand to tangle in the curls at the nape of Ryan&rsquo;s neck. The other drifts to her waist to make small comforting circles with her finger. The steady sound of Sophie&rsquo;s heartbeat in Ryan&rsquo;s ear already has sleep threatening to overtake her. She doesn&rsquo;t fight it. Her fingers that make imaginary letters across Sophie&rsquo;s chest suddenly stop short. The slow measured breaths that tickle Sophie&rsquo;s skin signal what was inevitable. Ryan&rsquo;s asleep.<span class=""Apple-converted-space"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Sophie continues her movements enjoying the quiet of the loft and the city. The window of peace in Gotham is small. There are only a couple of hours where everything is completely silent and unmoving before the world starts again and the city&rsquo;s underbelly wakes with a new taste for violence. Soon, Sophie begins to feel sleep touch her too. With Ryan&rsquo;s weight on top of her and her own exhaustion spreading through her body, it&rsquo;s not long before she joins Ryan and the rest of the city in stillness as the <strong>blue</strong> morning <strong>light</strong> melts into orange.</p>","thatoneblackgirl","","thatoneblackgirl",1,"Blue Light by Mitski","Blue Light by thatoneblackgirl","<div><strong>Blue Light by Mitski</strong></div><div>Blue Light by thatoneblackgirl</div>",2022-02-23,"47tkc0WVv9y0ZwPVh93g9Q","47tkc0WVv9y0ZwPVh93g9Q?utm_source=generator",0,"https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d0000b273c428f67b4a9b7e1114dfc117",0.243,0.419,2,-6.325,1,0.0277,0.473,"Story or Chapter Title, Notes","https://archiveofourown.org/works/37331407","2018-08-17","<a href=""https://archiveofourown.org/works/37331407"" target=""_blank""

I reminded him that our mother used to sing to us alllllll the time.

“I don’t know what you need, honey,” Sophie sighed. Worry began to creep into her mind when she suddenly heard the front door open. “Ryan!”

Ryan walked into the living room, tugging her coat off and tossing it on the couch and placing the cloth grocery bag she held down next to it. She smiled at the sight of her exhausted wife and the tiny ball of fury she held in her arms. “There’s my babies.” She walked right up to Sophie and gently pulled Miles from her arms. “My sweet baby boy, what’s wrong?”

Sophie slumped onto the couch and let out a heavy sigh. “I don’t know. I fed him, changed him-”

“Did you burp him after you fed him?”

“Of course.”

“Aw Miles, why are you crying?” Ryan asked the boy, who was still screaming bloody murder. Ryan held the child against her chest and kissed the side of his head, nuzzling against his dark curly hair. “I get a little bit crazy, baby, every time you call my name.. My heart beats a little bit faster, after, you are in my arms again.”

Sophie sat up slightly, watching as her wife sang to their cranky son, who immediately calmed at the sound of his mother’s soothing voice.

“You try to fight it, don't even try to hide it, emotions falling down like the rain.. I can't find the words to explain it, ain't it, crazy how I fall, every time you call my name,” Ryan sang quietly, rocking the infant in her arms.

“I got you, sweetheart. Mama’s got you, go back to sleep,” Ryan cooed. “My little angry baby. You were in here stressing your mommy out while I was at the store?”

“Yes,” Sophie groaned.

Ryan chuckled. “Okay honey, let’s get you back in your crib.” Sophie followed Ryan as she headed to the nursery. She leaned against the doorframe and watched Ryan put their son down in his crib, the baby already fast asleep.

“So, sing to him when he’s cranky. Got it,” Sophie yawned. “Why didn’t I think of that.” Ryan shuffled over to her wife, smiling.","<p>Writer's Beginning Notes:</p>

Ryan had not had enough drinks to message Sophie about this. She wasn’t sure she even could drink enough to make her ready to message Sophie without the alcohol literally killing her. She was still perplexed that Julia felt like them doing a jazz routine to Untouched was a good idea. All it did for Ryan was make her feel more frustrated this was all a ruse and that Sophie was shutting her out. It felt like Julia was playing a cruel joke on them. Especially after that kiss a few days earlier at the after party. It had felt so real to Ryan, and Sophie had initiated it! Had been the one to take it further first! And it had been for no particular reason, then she had just pulled away right after.","<p align=""left"">Chapter Title:<strong> Week 5 - Untouched</strong></p>

“I don’t know if I should be taking credit for that. You might have already been a little bit off.” Ryan surprised her.

She smiled before she even turned back to look over her shoulder.

“How long have you been standing there?”

“Long enough to know that you should probably let Tyrese sing that song.” She teased her with a goofy grin

“I’m joking. “ She grinned. “ Good morning..” The lack of sleep in her tone, got a bit softer with her greeting.

“Good Morning Ms. Wilder..” Sophie turned on her heels to face her.

Writer's Beginning Notes:

*waves* Hello, my lovelies! I decided to try my hand at a Wildmoore fic and what better way to do so than with Wildmoore week. I was nervous about posting, but thanks to the encouraging people on Twitter I decided to drop this little number.

Anyway, I hope you enjoy this story.

Mariah Carey inspires everything for me :)

Oh, and for my fellow Gleeks if there are any, there is a nod to Mr. Shue's failed wedding in this chapter.

...

will you dance with me underneath the stars?” Ryan suggested. She was not quite ready to go inside yet. There were times when she would climb on top of her van and look at the moon and the stars. They twinkled in the sky reminding her of little diamonds.

Sophie would deny Ryan anything she wanted, “I think we can do that. I never pegged you for a Hallmark-style romantic,” She teased.

“There is a lot you don’t know about me, Soph, but I’m sure we have all the time in the world for us to learn about each other,” She climbed off Sophie’s lap and held her hand out, “I owe the lady a dance.”

Sophie looked from Ryan’s eyes to her hand and placed her hand in Ryan’s. Sophie loved Ryan’s hands they  were always so soft, “Yes, you do.” She stood up as the song changed to Mariah Carey’s Underneath the Stars. It was very on-brand for their night.

They swayed to the music content to be in each other’s arms. This was the first time that Sophie had ever slow danced with a woman, and she loved it, “I’ve never slow danced with a woman before. I like it,” She gave Ryan a beatific smile.

“This will not be the last time, I will have you in my arms. I like dancing with you too,” There was nowhere else Ryan would rather be right now.

The song had changed and Sophie did not know how long they were dancing on the balcony, but she didn’t want to break the moment. Everything felt so right there were a couple of times she had dreamt of moments like this with Kate, but she knew that would never happen. Ryan was a much better fit even though they started out as enemies before anything, but they eventually became lovers. And Sophie wouldn’t change that for the world.

And just like that, she and Ryan would be dancing underneath the stars for years to come.","<p>Story Title: <strong>Underneath the Stars</strong></p>

Writer's Beginning Notes:

Wildmoore Week day 3: When you started shipping them
This one was HARD for me! Not because I couldn't pinpoint the when but because every time I tried to write about it, I had far too many thoughts and it turned into an essay on everything that was wrong with the Kate and Ange relationships. I didn't entirely get away from that but I wanted to submit something so here it is.

Now I know a lot of people started shipping Wildmoore from day 1 (and yes, their interaction in the interrogation room was intense and they're both hot as hell) but I have an issue with it being an assumption that just because two characters are gay they'll automatically be attracted to each other. ""As a lesbian,"" (yes, I say this like Sophie, hand raised and all, every time) I can't stress enough how much I do not want to jump the bones of every other lesbian I encounter. So, my stubborn ass held out until the emotions got involved and then I was a goner.

Also, the title is taken from the song Blink Twice by Joy Oladokun, which plays over the scene where Ange confronts Ryan and Sophie listens in. Doesn't matter how many times I watch/listen - it's just stunning.

Dream sweet dreams for me. Dream sweet dreams for you,” Sophie continued to rock lightly as she sang, a tear rolling down her cheek. “Close your eyes and I'll close mine, good night, sleep tight,” Sophie stopped singing as she cleared her throat. “My mom used to sing that to me when I was little,” Sophie pursed her lips as she felt another tear wanting to fall from her eyes. “I don’t really talk to my mom anymore, but you’ve got to take the good, huh?” Sophie questioned. “I do miss her, though,” Sophie admitted. “So much,” Sophie paused, taking a moment to keep herself composed, but she knew the tears would fall soon. “Mama says it’s her loss and I know she’s right but it’s not too much to ask for is it?” Sophie questioned, still rocking lightly in the chair. “To be loved and accepted for who are by your own mama?” Sophie couldn’t hold them in any longer, more tears rolling down her cheeks. “Even after all my mom said to me, what she’s said about me and Mama being together, the things she’s said to your mama, I…” Sophie pursed her lips and closed her eyes, desperate for the tears to stop. “Oh, baby girl, I’m sorry,” Sophie took a deep breath. “Maybe I’ll just go back to singing to you, huh? That’s nicer, right?” Sophie questioned. She stayed silent for a few moments, composing herself. “I know I don’t have the best singing voice, but Caleb likes it when I sing this song to him, so I hope you do too,” Sophie said, feeling a swell in her heart as she gazed at her newborn daughter who was fast asleep in her arms. “Now the moon begins to shine, good night, sleep tight,” Sophie started singing again. “Dream sweet dreams for me.

Sophie is dancing around the living room in a tank top and the smallest pair of shorts Ryan has ever seen Sophie wear. They might actually be Ryan’s based on how short they are on Sophie. Ryan isn’t complaining though, because that gives her the chance to see those long legs of Sophie’s that she loves so much.




What yall know about a supermodel?




Usher’s Bad Girl is playing through the speaker. 




Fresh out of Elle magazine

Buy her own bottles




This is one of Ryan’s favorite songs, and it is perfect for this moment because Sophie embodies everything about this song; she truly is a supermodel. Ryan would put Sophie in any magazine and would buy every single copy.




Bad than a mother.




Usher sings. Sophie is definitely bad than a mother.




Ryan watches as Sophie dances around the room while sweeping the floor; she can’t help the smile that shines across her face as she watches Sophie be so light and carefree. Ryan can't believe she really gets to call this woman hers.




Ohhh, work me, baby

Shaking it the way I like

I’m ready to be bad

I need a bad girl (say yeah)




Sophie uses the broom in her hand as a microphone as she sings the words to the song, unintentionally giving Ryan a full performance. She’s dancing and moving her hips to the music; her back is to Ryan, so Sophie can’t see the look that Ryan is giving her. She can’t see the way Ryan’s eyes are roaming her body, taking in her endlessly long legs in Ryan’s shorts that also accentuate her ass. Ryan bites her lip, thinking about how she wants to be between those legs right now.




It is so rare that Ryan gets to see Sophie like this that she doesn’t want to interrupt her moment, but she also wants to join in because it really looks like Sophie is having fun. She hasn’t noticed Ryan because she is in her own world having a great time.




What sexy lady’s 

Coming home with me tonight?

I’m ready to be bad

I need a bad girl (super bad, baby)

Get at me, bad girl.




Ryan pushes off the wall and slides across the room until she is right behind Sophie. She puts her hands on Sophie’s waist to press herself against Sophie’s back, causing her to jump in surprise. 




Sophie turns around, shocked, not expecting Ryan to be behind her.




“Jesus, Ryan. You scared me.” Sophie says, covering her chest with her hand to catch her breath.




“I’m sorry, babe, but you just looked so cute and like you were having so much fun, and I wanted to join in.” Ryan does look apologetic for scaring Sophie, but her pout is so cute that Sophie can’t be mad at her. 




Ohh, work me, baby

Shaking it the way I like

I’m ready to be bad

I need a bad girl (say, yeah).




With her hands still on Sophie’s waist, Ryan turns her around and starts singing the words to the song while moving Sophie’s hips from side to side. It doesn’t take long for Sophie to join in, singing and dancing along to the music with Ryan. The energy between them is light and cheerful just like the song, and they become consumed with the music and each other. If there was anyone else in the room, it wouldn't matter because all they see right now is each other. 




They both sing the bridge of the song at the top of their lungs (a little out of tune) since it is their favorite part of the song. 




If you wanna party

I got what you're looking for

Come see me in the VIP 

It’s very necessary 

To be that kind of girl for me

If you are, then, baby girl, let’s leave.




Ryan grabs the broom from Sophie’s hand and balances it against the counter. She takes both of Sophie’s hands in hers and starts walking back towards the bedroom with a mischievous smirk on her face. Sophie knows exactly where Ryan is going with this and plays hard to get, resisting Ryan’s pull to the bedroom. 




“Get at me, bad girl,” Ryan winks, and Sophie can’t help but laugh and let Ryan pull her until they are flush together. 




Sophie rests her arms around Ryan’s neck and they move together to the music as Ryan walks backward, trying to get to her original destination.




“Imma get me one of them,” Sophie sings to Ryan.




By the end of the outro, they are back in the bedroom, and Ryan is showing Sophie just how much she appreciates her “bad girl”. 




Get at me, bad girl.

<p><strong><em>I&rsquo;m ready to be bad</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>I need a bad girl (say, yeah).</em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With her hands still on Sophie&rsquo;s waist, Ryan turns her around and starts singing the words to the song while moving Sophie&rsquo;s hips from side to side. It doesn&rsquo;t take long for Sophie to join in, singing and dancing along to the music with Ryan. The energy between them is light and cheerful just like the song, and they become consumed with the music and each other. If there was anyone else in the room, it wouldn't matter because all they see right now is each other.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They both sing the bridge of the song at the top of their lungs (a little out of tune) since it is their favorite part of the song.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>If you wanna party</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>I got what you're looking for</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Come see me in the VIP&nbsp;</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>It&rsquo;s very necessary&nbsp;</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>To be that kind of girl for me</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>If you are, then, baby girl, let&rsquo;s leave.</em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ryan grabs the broom from Sophie&rsquo;s hand and balances it against the counter. She takes both of Sophie&rsquo;s hands in hers and starts walking back towards the bedroom with a mischievous smirk on her face. Sophie knows exactly where Ryan is going with this and plays hard to get, resisting Ryan&rsquo;s pull to the bedroom.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<strong>Get at me, bad girl</strong>,&rdquo; Ryan winks, and Sophie can&rsquo;t help but laugh and let Ryan pull her until they are flush together.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sophie rests her arms around Ryan&rsquo;s neck and they move together to the music as Ryan walks backward, trying to get to her original destination.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Imma get me one of them</strong>,&rdquo; Sophie sings to Ryan.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By the end of the outro, they are back in the bedroom, and Ryan is showing Sophie just how much she appreciates her &ldquo;<strong>bad girl</strong>&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Get at me, bad girl.</em></strong></p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Writer's End Notes:</p>
<p>It took me a while to narrow down the one song to use but <strong>Bad Girl</strong> is one of my favorite songs and Confessions is one of my favorite albums so I had to do it!</p>","neo4_urSOUL","","neo4_urSOUL",1,"Bad Girl by USHER","Bad Girl by neo4_urSOUL","<div><strong>Bad Girl by USHER</strong></div><div>Bad Girl by neo4_urSOUL</div>",2022-03-16,"5rPzPAaOUceS8HiAculegz","5rPzPAaOUceS8HiAculegz?utm_source=generator",0,"https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d0000b273365b3fb800c19f7ff72602da",0.777,0.829,6,-6.905,0,0.268,0.245,"Story or Chapter Title, Played, Dancing, Home, Singing","https://archiveofourown.org/works/37762045","2004-03-23","<a href=""https://archiveofourown.org/works/37762045"" target=""_blank""

Title, lyrics and inspiration from Comfortable by H.E.R (the song just does things to me)

I am fairly certain that Sophie has never taken a woman back to her bed and if I've missed something in the show I want to remain oblivious!

Happy Wildmoore Week!

...

‘You don’t have to explain…’ But the croak in her voice contradicts what she’s saying. And they promised they wouldn’t hide from each other anymore. Ryan grips tighter to her hand, not wanting to risk her pulling away even though she’s the one battling the urge to bolt whilst Sophie remains ever solid. ‘I don’t know why this is bothering me, it’s not like we don’t both have pasts; this isn’t a first for either of us.’

‘It is for me.’ Sophie bends her knees to pull her legs up onto the seat, closing the circuit of their limbs, creating an insulated space for them to have this discussion. ‘I told you, this is my first time being in an out relationship with a woman. Before this - before you - being out, becoming comfortable with who I am and in my own skin, it didn’t really extend beyond myself and my body. I shared my home with someone before and it almost destroyed me. Him too. And as confident as I was that being gay was my truth, I wasn’t prepared to rush into that again. Or at all really. I didn’t want it to be for nothing, I didn’t want it cheapened by bringing just any woman back. I needed it to be right this time. I needed to be right this time. And it wasn’t until I admitted my feelings for you that I finally understood what that meant. I’m not just comfortable within myself now, I’m comfortable opening myself and my life up to something worthy. Someone. I’m comfortable, because of you. For you…With you.’

'Cause I feel so comfortable with you
You make me comfortable with you
I feel so comfortable with you
You make me comfortable with you
You make me…

Ryan hasn’t moved, hasn’t blinked, maybe hasn’t breathed. Every thought in her head slow crawls through syrup, decidedly sweet but sticking, unable to make its way out. Her toes tingle, noises that she logically knows she can’t hear are loud against the silence – her blood rushing to pool in the parts of her body that need it most, Sophie’s heartbeat. She inhales, hitched and shuddering, willing herself to stay present and not go hurtling a hundred miles an hour into what has been or what could be. She simultaneously has so many regrets and none at all; so many concerns and the sensation of total calm. Sophie Moore continues to make her ask all the questions she’s spent a lifetime avoiding, and to be all the answers she’s ever needed.

‘Take me to bed.’ Ryan’s voice is thick, eyes so glazed with emotion, her body so pliable, she’s not sure she’d make it there alone. ‘Please.’

Day 4 of Wildmoore Week and it has been great participating. I had two storylines that I put together in one story (don't judge me). Here are songs that I think encompass the vibe of Wildmoore.

Sophie's Song

Ryan and Sophie are laying in bed as their gazing into each other eyes after a long day of Batwoman saving the day. Sophie reached for her phone on the side of the bed and went to her Tidal playlist “Love Songs.”

“I want to play a song for you Ryan. Is that okay?” Sophie asked.

Ryan smiled “Of course.”

Sophie found the song “Rather Be” by H.E.R. and it flowed through her wireless speaker in the room. Sophie and Ryan shifted in bed to lay on their backs as they both got lost in the lyrics in the song.

Thoughts of you running through my head
As I lie awake in my bed, ooh
Know you want this, don't be afraid, baby
And now we're standing face to face
Baby, tell it to me now
Everything you dreamed about
Don't make sense to run around and ooh, it's now or never

Remember this night
Show me how you feel
Let me know it's real tonight, oh

There's nowhere I'd rather be than here with you, ooh ooh, you, you
There's nowhere I'd rather be than here with you, ooh ooh, you, you
There's no place I'd rather be

Ryan reached over and pressed pause on Sophie’s phone.

Sophie got a little scared that she may have involuntarily given to much of her feelings away in the song she chose. “Are you okay? Did you not like the song?” Sophie asked Ryan.

Ryan smiled “I loved the song” Ryan caressed Sophie face while looking into her light brown eyes. “I feel the same way, Sophie. There is no other place I rather be than here with you too.”

Sophie felt all her emotions coming in at once and she gave a little smile as Ryan leaned in to kiss her softly. It was supposed to be a little kiss for comforting to let Sophie know that she will always be there then it got heated so quickly as their emotions took over them. Ryan straddled Sophie and pushed her caramel brown hair away from her face and pulled away from their kiss to look down at Sophie lovingly. They may have not said the words yet but they both felt it and they showed each other what they meant to each other with their kiss.","<p>Summary: Sophie and Ryan are laying in bed and Sophie asked Ryan can she play a song for her.

Ryan's Song

It was another long shift for the Bat Team as Batwoman and Batwing were out patrolling, Mary was tending to patients and Sophie was manning the fort.

“Sophie can you mute Luke’s comms” Ryan (Batwoman) asked.

“Uh why?” Sophie asked perplexed.

“Yea…why? And that’s rude.” Luke said sounded offended.

“Please do it Sophie” Ryan begged.

“Okay.” Sophie muted Luke’s comms “What’s wrong Ryan?” She asked concerned.

“Nothing is wrong…I just didn’t want Luke to hear what I’m about to say to you.” Ryan stated. “He has a big mouth and would tell Mary.”

Sophie shook her head in agreement “Yes. He will. What do you have to tell me?” Sophie asked.

Ryan started “The other night…when we were...uh...listening to music” Sophie face grew concerned.

“Yes? What about it?” Sophie asked.

“Sophie, I want to tell you how I feel but I don’t’ know how but I found a song that says it for me.”

Sophie smiled because she knew that was hard for Ryan to admit. “Okay, what’s the song I’ll look it up.”

“About that…so I added it to the playlist you had open when you played the song for me. You were sleep and I didn’t want to disturb you.”

Sophie smiled. “Okay I found it. It’s called “Butterflies”?

“Yes.” Ryan smiled.

“Okay…I’ll listen to it right now” Sophie said.

“Uh can you take Luke off mute first.” Ryan said.

“Yep…he’s unmuted. Hey, Luke, you’re back on.” Sophie stated.

There was no answer. “Luke. Luke are you there?” Sophie grew worried. “Ryan I can’t re-“

“I’m here.” Luke answered

“Why didn’t you say anything?” Ryan asked.

“Because Sophie didn’t put me on mute…I heard the whole conversation, so I put myself on mute.”

Ryan and Sophie groaned.

As Ryan and Luke were going back and forth. Sophie decided to listen to the song Ryan suggested.




Butterlies by Queen Naija

I don't wanna fall so fast
But I'm open
They always say that good things never last
And I know 'cause I've been broken
I'm tryin' to protect my heart
But you're making it so hard
And I guess it's safe to say
You take my pain away

And I just wanna hold you all night long
Whenever I'm around you, nothing's wrong
I'm hoping that you'll always be around
You got me on a high, I don't wanna come down
And I love it, I love it (these butterflies)
Yeah I love it, I love it (I'm on a high)
Yeah, I love it, I love it
And I just wanna love on you (ooh)

Ever since you crossed my path
Everything is different
You always know just how to make me laugh
You got me all up in my feelings
And as much as I love the feeling
I hate it, it gets me frustrated
Wanna say just how I feel
But don't know how you would take it
Why do you do what you do to me?
Got me doing things that I don't do usually
I promised myself I wouldn't fall
But every time I see you, I just wanna risk it all
And baby, yeah, I know it ain't right
But the chemistry we have is so hard to fight

And I just wanna hold you all night long
Whenever I'm around you, nothing's wrong
I'm hoping that you'll always be around
You got me on a high, I don't wanna come down
And I love it, I love it (these butterflies)
Said I love it, I love it (I'm on a high)
Love (And I just wanna love on)
And I just wanna love on you

Just wanna love, just wanna love on ya (uh, uh)
Just wanna love, just wanna love on ya (uh, uh)
Ay, ay (uh, uh)

Sophie stopped the song as she heard Luke say that they were on their way back to the Batcave.

Sophie stood up from the chair when she saw Ryan and grabbed her face and kissed her. She heard Luke say “Not in the Batcave guys” but all she cared about in the moment was Ryan.

Ryan was taken aback “Whoa…I was only gone for two hours.” She said playfully.

Sophie smiled. “I listened to your song.”

“Oh yeah” Ryan said shyly “What did you think?”

Sophie pulled her closer “I think that was the perfect song to describe us.”

Ryan leaned back in the embrace to peer up at Sophie “How so?”

Sophie took a deep breath “Ryan, I am falling too so don’t think it’s one-sided and when I’m close to you…you give me butterflies too.”

Ryan smiled and leaned in to kiss Sophie. “I’m so lucky” Ryan stated.

Sophie smiled. “Yes, you are.”","<p>Writer's Beginning Notes:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sophie, I want to tell you how I feel but I don&rsquo;t&rsquo; know how but I found a song that says it for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sophie smiled because she knew that was hard for Ryan to admit. &ldquo;Okay, what&rsquo;s the song I&rsquo;ll look it up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About that&hellip;so I added it to the playlist you had open when you played the song for me. You were sleep and I didn&rsquo;t want to disturb you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sophie smiled. &ldquo;Okay I found it. It&rsquo;s called &ldquo;Butterflies&rdquo;?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Ryan smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay&hellip;I&rsquo;ll listen to it right now&rdquo; Sophie said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uh can you take Luke off mute first.&rdquo; Ryan said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yep&hellip;he&rsquo;s unmuted. Hey, Luke, you&rsquo;re back on.&rdquo; Sophie stated.</p>
<p>There was no answer. &ldquo;Luke. Luke are you there?&rdquo; Sophie grew worried. &ldquo;Ryan I can&rsquo;t re-&ldquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m here.&rdquo; Luke answered</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you say anything?&rdquo; Ryan asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because Sophie didn&rsquo;t put me on mute&hellip;I heard the whole conversation, so I put myself on mute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ryan and Sophie groaned.</p>
<p>As Ryan and Luke were going back and forth. Sophie decided to listen to the song Ryan suggested.</p>

<p>Sophie stopped the song as she heard Luke say that they were on their way back to the Batcave.</p>
<p>Sophie stood up from the chair when she saw Ryan and grabbed her face and kissed her. She heard Luke say &ldquo;Not in the Batcave guys&rdquo; but all she cared about in the moment was Ryan.</p>
<p>Ryan was taken aback &ldquo;Whoa&hellip;I was only gone for two hours.&rdquo; She said playfully.</p>
<p>Sophie smiled. &ldquo;I listened to your song.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yeah&rdquo; Ryan said shyly &ldquo;What did you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sophie pulled her closer &ldquo;I think that was the perfect song to describe us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ryan leaned back in the embrace to peer up at Sophie &ldquo;How so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sophie took a deep breath &ldquo;Ryan, I am falling too so don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s one-sided and when I&rsquo;m close to you&hellip;you give me butterflies too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ryan smiled and leaned in to kiss Sophie. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so lucky&rdquo; Ryan stated.</p>

"Best Part","Daniel Caesar","H.E.R.","","","Daniel Caesar, H.E.R.","It Could All Be So Simple","Ryan looked up at her and leaned in to lightly brush her lips against Sophie softly. She did it one time to gauge Sophie’s reaction, Sophie didn’t resist so she lightly touched her face with her hand and kissed her slowly two more times. The kiss was slow, intimate, light just soft touches against their lips as to familiarize themselves with each other. The waiter came back with their food and Ryan and Sophie broke apart. The waiter asked if they wanted anything else and Ryan told him she needed something stronger than wine, so she ordered a Whiskey Sour and Sophie ordered a Martini.

Ryan and Sophie ate their food and sat in comfortable silence as the band played “Best Part” by H.E.R and Daniel Caesar. After finishing their meal and their first round of drinks they ordered more while the music in the background became their soundtrack. It played every song of how they were feeling in the moment from “At Your Best (You Are Love)” by Aaliyah to “Get You” by Daniel Caesar and Kali Uchis. As the music was playing Ryan leaned her head back in the booth to look up at Sophie who was looking down at her.
“God, I love your eyes.” Ryan said feeling relaxed after a couple of drinks.

Sophie was feeling relaxed too. “I love your lips.” She said while her hand caressed Ryan’s face and her thumb grazed Ryan’s lips.

Ryan took the opportunity to stick her tongue out while Sophie’s thumb was on her lips and lick it slowly. Sophie’s eyes grew wide and heated as that one touch sent a vibration through her body. Ryan slowly grabbed the back of Sophie’s neck to pull her in to kiss her.

You had faith in me in a way that no one else ever had, and you’ve always wanted the best for me, even when you hated me. Then when we became friends, you became my fiercest supporter and so encouraging, and after we finished dancing around this thing between us and made it officially official, you became the fiercest lover I’ve ever had. You’ve shown me a love that I never thought I could have; you love all of me not despite my flaws but because of them.

They are both crying by the time Sophie finishes her speech, but Ryan somehow finds her voice to answer.

“Of course, I’ll marry you, Sophie. There’s nothing in this world that I want more than to spend the rest of our lives together.” Sophie takes the ring out of the box with shaky hands and places it on Ryan’s finger.

...

Sophie stands and reaches out her hands to help Ryan to her feet. She pulls Ryan to her body, and Ryan raises onto her tiptoes to give Sophie another kiss. 

“Let's go home, wifey.” Ryan jokes, Sophie throws her head back in laughter.

“What? You don’t like wifey?” Ryan laughs.

“I do. I like it. I just wasn’t expecting it.” Sophie takes Ryan’s hand and heads back to her car.

They get in the car and both laugh at the song that just so happens to be playing.

Will you be my wifey? Next-Wifey plays through the car.

<p>&ldquo;Of course, I&rsquo;ll marry you, Sophie. There&rsquo;s nothing in this world that I want more than to spend the rest of our lives together.&rdquo; Sophie takes the ring out of the box with shaky hands and places it on Ryan&rsquo;s finger.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Sophie stands and reaches out her hands to help Ryan to her feet. She pulls Ryan to her body, and Ryan raises onto her tiptoes to give Sophie another kiss.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let's go home, wifey.&rdquo; Ryan jokes, Sophie throws her head back in laughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What? You don&rsquo;t like wifey?&rdquo; Ryan laughs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do. I like it. I just wasn&rsquo;t expecting it.&rdquo; Sophie takes Ryan&rsquo;s hand and heads back to her car.</p>
<p>They get in the car and both laugh at the song that just so happens to be playing.</p>
<p><em>Will you be my wifey?&nbsp;</em><strong>Next-Wifey</strong> plays through the car.</p>
<p>They both look at each other and laugh but respond at the same time.</p>

"Like A Star","Corinne Bailey Rae","","","","Corinne Bailey Rae","Gotham Greys","“Theo, you want to play a song?”

Sophie’s voice finally pulls Ryan’s attention. Ryan watches her as gets off the couch and moves across the room to the record player and speakers Luke set up as their house warming gift. Theo is up and following her. He puts his small hand on her shoulder when she kneels to look for the perfect song to play, and leans in deeper than necessary to get a better view. Sophie holds the record up so only he can see it but speaks loudly enough for Ryan to hear. 

“Should we play this one?”

“Yes!” 

Theo bounces with excitement and watches his mother uncover the vinyl and place it carefully on the turntable. After she closes the glass top Theo presses the button for the needle to settle in the grooves of the plastic. The record crackles and comes alive as Corinne Bailey Rae begins to sing “Just like a star across my sky, just like an angel off the page”. Behind them, Ryan smiles at the choice of song, their wedding song. Sophie stands again bringing Theo up into her arms. She positions him on her hip with one arm, the other on his back as she begins to dance around the room as Corinne croons, “You have appeared to my life, feel like I’ll never be the same.”

Sophie moves to the slow and steady rhythm as she spins and dips herself and the other love of her life. Theo is a fit of giggles by the third dip as Sophie sings along to the music,

“You’ve got this look I can’t describe. You make me feel I’m alive.” Ryan watches them from the couch. The coffee in her hand isn’t as warm as it was as if the temperature had moved directly to her chest instead. Sophie turns again, this time facing Ryan, and outstretches her hand. “Are you going to join us?”

Theo mimics her holding out his own small hand. Ryan can’t, won’t, resist the tug they both make at her heart strings and follows the feeling to where they are in the room. Ryan positions herself against her wife, resting her head on her shoulder, and wraps her arms around Sophie and their son. The three of them sway around the room to the music as the rain outside falls harder, and with each lyric so do Sophie and Ryan.

The needle clicks too soon signaling the end of the song and Ryan looks at the peaceful face next to her. The smile that spreads across her own is one of contentment and relief. 

“Soph, you did it. He’s out.”

Finally, finally, the rambunctious toddler sleeps. His face is pressed against Sophie in a way that makes his cheeks look fatter, his small pajama-covered arms and legs dangle limply as he rests. Sophie gently runs a hand over his plush jet-black curls. 

“Let’s hurry before he wakes up again.” 

Ryan leads the way to the other end of their home to Theo’s bedroom and watches Sophie as she lays him down in his own bed and draws the blankets over him before tucking his favorite Batarang-shaped plushie in with him. 

Before long they are back on the couch wrapped around each other, alone and child-free. 

“How’d you like the singing? I think I did pretty well.” Sophie asks as she lays down back against the pillows pulling Ryan into her. She follows with no hesitation and kisses Sophie. 

“It was interesting.”

“Interesting? Now, who’s the one that’s hard to please?”

Ryan doesn’t answer and instead captures Sophie’s lips with her own once again. She understands now why the rainy days of Gotham are Sophie’s favorite. The lull of the city doesn’t come often, and when it did moments like these feel the most special. The dreary greyness of the sky doesn’t seem so bad when the light of your life kisses you senseless. 

The Gotham rain doesn’t let up, and neither do Sophie and Ryan as they recreate the torrent outside whispering, sputtering, stopping to begin again washing away all other sounds in the city until the clouds break. ","<p>&ldquo;Theo, you want to play a song?&rdquo;</p>

Writer's Beginning Notes:

Song: Cherish the Day by Sade was recommended by @ The Vaporz on Twitter.

...

The song changed and one of their favorites started playing as Ryan turned to Sophie with an excited smile. It wasn't exactly on the itinerary but Sophie put her glass down and gently took Ryan's and placed in on the table as well. She held out her hand and Ryan took it immediately allowing Sophie to pull her up from the table and wrap her other arm around her waist just as the vocals began. 

'You're ruling the way that I move
And I breathe your air
You only can rescue me
This is my prayer

Sophie smiled at Ryan singing along in a whispered tone. 

I cherish the day
I won't go astray
I won't be afraid
You won't catch me running
You're ruling the way that I move'

Ryan rested her head on Sophie's chest as they danced under the stars. Sophie pulled Ryan in even closer wrapping her arms tighter around her waist. 

'You take my air

You show me how deep love can be

Ryan pulls back so that she can look into Sophie's eyes. ""Who knew you were so romantic?"" She teased, with that twinkle in her eyes and a smile so bright, Sophie would have been so weak in the knees she'd fall if Ryan wasn't holding onto her so tightly. 

You're ruling the way that I move
And I breathe your air
You only can rescue me
This is my prayer

With an idea and sparkle in her own eyes, Sophie grabbed one of Ryan's hands. ""You haven't seen anything yet."" And she raised their joined hands up and used her wrist to spin Ryan around underneath them, throwing Ryan completely off-guard and off balance with gasp, before Sophie grabbed her waist and pulled her right back in close against her. Ryan's eye darkened and her eyebrows raised in disbelief for what felt like maybe the third time that night. ""Impressed?"" 

I cherish the day
I won't go astray
I won't be afraid
You won't catch me running'

""When did Mama teach you how to dance?"" Ryan tilted her head and Sophie rolled her eyes at Ryan's ability to just know everything all the time, well almost everything. Sophie shrugged feigning ignorance as they swayed in each other's arms quietly getting lost in the other's eyes. 

You show me how deep love can be
You show me how deep love can be
This is my prayer

I cherish the day
I won't go astray
I won't be afraid
Won't run away
Won't shy

As the song faded out, they still stood close with Ryan's head back on Sophie's chest listening to her racing heartbeat and Sophie's arms wrapped behind Ryan's back. Sophie almost didn't want to interrupt the moment but she sticking to her schedule settled her nerves. ""Ry?"" She whispered not wanted to break the peaceful quiet of their embrace. Ryan hummed. ""I love you, you know that?"" 

That made Ryan look up smiling. ""I do.""","<p>Chapter Title: <strong>You Show Me How Deep Love Can Be</strong></p>

The icy chill that had threatened to bring her body to a standstill was replaced by a spark so tiny that all it would take was a careless breath to extinguish it. She murmured her thanks to her mother and was about to leave when she heard the first lines of Amazing Grace being sung by a choir just ahead.

If I had to choose just one artist's music to be the score for scenes of Wildmoore, I'd choose H.E.R. She's who I hear in my head whenever they're together. This was written after 309 as a personal wish fulfillment, and was originally titled ""Rest."" More at the end.

S: To the couch...but I can stay?

Ryan responds with a small smile. Sophie turns slightly, but doesn't leave.

S: Get in.

When the shuffling ends, Sophie sits on the floor next to the tub and a fully submerged Ryan whose knees are to her chest.

R: Thank you. I honestly can't remember the last time I've done this.
S: I figured as much.

Ryan closes her eyes, looking tired but content. They both sit quietly, listening to ""Let Me In"" by H.E.R. playing in the background. Ryan grins.

S: What?
R: I like this song.
S: Do you?

Sophie looks skeptical this time. Ryan only responds by widening her smile, knowingly, still not opening her eyes.

Sophie gets off the floor and stretches her back and legs out before going into the bathroom to look at her hair.

Looking in the mirror, Sophie thinks the twist looks so cute. From the way Ryan described it, it sounded like she might look a little childish with this hairstyle, but Ryan absolutely came through with this style. Sophie shakes her head, letting her twist shake around a bit.

“Shake the dreads,” Sophie chuckles to herself, rapping the words to “Tell Me When To Go” softly to herself. This must be what people with locs feel like when this part of the song comes on because Sophie is so giddy and pleased with herself for shaking her head and making her twist bounce.

“How do you like it?” Ryan asks as she comes into the bathroom.

“I love it. Thank you, babe.” Sophie wraps her arms around Ryan's when she stands back up from putting away the hair stuff under the cabinet. She kisses the other woman on the cheek and sits her head on Ryan’s should as they take a moment to look at each other in the mirror.

...

Sophie stands off to the side of the stage, waiting for the last act of the night to finish, trying desperately to pay attention to his lyrics instead of the narrative running around her own head, threatening to talk her out of this. She’d insisted that Jordan return to the bar, her enthusiastic pep talk beginning to feel like a rollercoaster climbing to its highest peak; she didn’t want to risk hitting that drop prematurely. She ducks down next to the guy on keys whilst the crowd are still cheering what they think is the end of the show, talking directly into his ear to be heard and hoping he understands. He takes out his phone and quickly pulls up a Youtube video that shows that he does. Sophie nods, smiling her thanks as the previous performer leaves the makeshift stage and the rest of the band begin to look to them for explanation.

‘You lot clock off,’ the guy says, placing his hand briefly, knowingly, on Sophie’s arm. ‘I got this one.’

He indicates the stool set up in front of the microphone and Sophie sits down, closing her eyes and drawing a calming breath as the unexpected notes from the keyboard once again quiet the crowd.




You’ve been on my mind

I grow fonder every day

Lose myself in time

Just thinking of your face




God only knows

Why it’s taken me so long

To let my doubts go

You’re the only one that I want

 

It’s been a long time and it’s not how she remembered it. Terrifying, yes, still that, but also freeing, weightless, like she’s stepped out, not of herself but of everything she carries unwillingly. She squeezes her eyes tighter against the fear, allows the total silence beyond the keyboard and her voice to embrace her and hold her steady.




I don’t know why I’m scared

I’ve been here before

Every feeling, every word

I’ve imagined it all

You’ll never know if you never try

To forgive the past and simply be mine

 

The usual rasp of Sophie’s voice lends itself flawlessly to the stripped-back version of the song, curling around each syllable like it’s a language written exclusively for her tongue. Her hand shakes a little where it grips around the mic, but her mouth doesn’t falter at all.




I dare you to let me be your one and only

I promise I’m worthy, to hold in your arms

So come on and give me the chance

To prove I am the one who can

Walk that mile

Until the end starts




‘What the…?’ Mary’s whisper barely registers as sound as she comes up beside a stock-still Ryan behind the bar.

‘Oh yeah, sis can sing,’ Jordan fills in for them, looking between her sister’s pitch perfect soul-bearing and Ryan’s slack jaw with unbridled joy – damn, she loves being right. ‘She needs a reason though. Something important enough to make her willingly give up that control-freak nature she hones on the daily and expose the stuff she struggles to talk about. Something real.’




Have I been on your mind?

Do you hang on every word I say?

Lose yourself in time

At the mention of my name

 

Her eyes lock onto Ryan’s as soon as they open, every ounce of pent-up frustration hitching a ride on the words in the pearled gravel of her tone. No room for ambiguity, not anymore.




Will I ever know

How it feels to hold you close

And have you tell me

Whichever road I choose, you’ll go

 

And Ryan’s insides implode.




I don’t know why I’m scared

Cause I’ve been here before

Every feeling, every word

I’ve imagined it all

You’ll never know if you never try

To forgive my past and simply be mine




The fight or flight is lost, given in entirely to freezing though she burns from the inside out. She’s trapped here, in her own body and in Sophie’s gaze, her outsides numb to everything but her whilst her insides feel absolutely everything there is at once.




So, I dare you to let me be your one and only

I promise I’m worthy, to hold in your arms

So come on and give me the chance

To prove I am the one who can

Walk that mile

Until the end starts




The stunned silence that permeates the room as her voice builds raw beauty and grit on every note is enough to allow them both to step out of it. Whilst Sophie sings, they’re not in a packed bar, they’re not in the middle of fighting each other, their history, the future, the next Gotham villain, every unjust system and situation they encounter. Whilst Sophie sings, their fears are suspended, time not stopping but becoming irrelevant.




I know it aint easy, giving up your heart

I know it aint easy, giving up your heart

I know…




Whilst Sophie sings, Ryan doesn’t have to fear or fight or flee. Whilst Sophie sings, to her, she can be still.




Until the end starts.

 

The whole bar erupts and Ryan freefalls, every single thing she’d been avoiding flooding in like her very own Gotham Dam has ruptured, the applause like an additional tidal wave about to crash down on her when she’s already drowning. Sophie reaches out a hand to gently squeeze her thanks into the arm of the keyboardist, feels him return it with an uttered ‘wow’ but can’t tear her eyes from the path Ryan takes as she bolts from behind the bar. One way or another, for both of their sakes, this has to end now.

Writer's End Notes:

This turned out way longer than intended! Got the idea a few weeks ago when waiting on a delayed airport pick up and a live, stripped back version of Adele: One and Only came on an old playlist. The raw, gritty frustration she sings the song with just made me think of Sophie, and in this particular performance Adele changes the line ''forgive the past"" each time, using ""my"", ""your"", and ""our"", and that was me sold on writing this fic. Plus, the rest of the lyrics are pretty spot on for these two and their lingering lovestruck gazes.

And if Sophie could actually sing like that, I would be an actual puddle. I actually can't think too much about it because I'd never get anything done.

Hope you enjoy!","<p>Story Title: <strong>On My Mind</strong></p>

I'm back again! This would have been done a looong time ago but a busted hand and covid kinda messed me up during the actual week. But I do have the rest of the week finally done so stick around and keep an eye out for some more Wildmoore fun!

First up is some sexy goodness. When I was thinking of Wildmoore and songs; of course Victoria Monet's ""Touch Me"" came to mind and this is result. Give both versions a listen either before you read or during. It sets the vibe pretty well. Also, I haven't written smut in a while so hopefully y'all like it (and any critiques or advice on how to write it better are appreciated too).

Wildmoore Week Day 4: Quotes/Songs

I'm back again! This would have been done a looong time ago but a busted hand and covid kinda messed me up during the actual week. But I do have the rest of the week finally done so stick around and keep an eye out for some more Wildmoore fun!

First up is some sexy goodness. When I was thinking of Wildmoore and songs; of course Victoria Monet's ""Touch Me"" came to mind and this is result. Give both versions a listen either before you read or during. It sets the vibe pretty well. Also, I haven't written smut in a while so hopefully y'all like it (and any critiques or advice on how to write it better are appreciated too).
Enjoy!

<p>Lucky for blondie, her inquiry came just as the DJ mixed the song into <strong>Good in Bed</strong>, one of Sophie&rsquo;s favorites. She smiled and nodded her agreement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Devan, by the way.&rdquo; A name to face alas, as she took Sophie&rsquo;s hand and guided her deeper into the crowd.</p>
<p>Once they got to an open spot, Devan spun Sophie around and moved her hands to Sophie&rsquo;s hips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sophie.&rdquo; They were already all up in each other&rsquo;s space so raising her arms to Devan&rsquo;s shoulders felt somewhat natural. Their bodies moved mostly in sync though Sophie&rsquo;s mind may or may not have been wandering to the bite-sized bartender across the room.</p>","almag","","almag",1,"Good In Bed by Dua Lipa","Go There With You by almag","<div><strong>Good In Bed by Dua Lipa</strong></div><div>Go There With You by almag</div>",2022-04-13,"6uAFJ75WDAoAPyCWJAtvks","6uAFJ75WDAoAPyCWJAtvks?utm_source=generator",0,"https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d0000b2734bc66095f8a70bc4e6593f4f",0.68,0.701,5,-5.001,1,0.0917,0.138,"Dancing, Played, Bar","https://archiveofourown.org/works/38075815","2020-03-27","<a href=""https://archiveofourown.org/works/38075815"" target=""_blank""

"Feels","Kehlani","","","","Kehlani","Go There With You","“You ready to get back out there?” Devan’s smile was hopeful and sweet. Sophie returned the gesture because, well what else was there do to..watch Ryan and whats her names’ flirty antics at the bar all night? She stuttered to a stop when her eyes found Ryan and the aforementioned patron dancing just a few feet away. Ryan was moving her hips against the customer’s pelvic in a hypnotic motion that made Sophie feel almost queasy. She noted the other woman’s left hand comfortably sitting on Ryan’s hip, as her right laced with one of Ryan’s own.

Feels was playing and she watched Ryan use their laced fingers to spin herself around so that she and her dance partner were face to face, mirroring the position she was in with Devan. Oh shit, Devan. Sophie hurriedly turned her attention back to Devan as they danced, not quite as close as they had been before. She felt Devan’s hands roam up her arms and settle in a loose grip around her neck. She forced her gaze to stay focused on Devan and their own dancing, but her mind and eyes were like magnets to Ryan and her every moment. Sophie tried earnestly to look elsewhere but kept finding her eyes trail over to the woman who was sexily dancing with someone else– so close yet so far.

Knew right from the start there was no limit to ya And I'm catching feelings, baby
You give me feels and I
Know that it, know that it, know that it's real You give me, you give me feels
You give me feels and I
Know that it, know that it, know that it's real

In that particular moment, Ryan looked up and met Sophie’s eyes. She grinned and wagged her eyebrows suggestively. In those brief seconds, Ryan’s little dancing partner interrupted their moment with roaming hands moving up Ryan’s full hips and over her slightly exposed stomach. The sensual display set something off in Sophie that she couldn’t ignore or placate in a crowd of people so the taller Moore abruptly stopped dancing and mumbled something quickly to Devan about going to the restroom. There was no wait for a response as she zipped across the dance floor and towards the bathroom without looking back.","<p>&ldquo;You ready to get back out there?&rdquo; Devan&rsquo;s smile was hopeful and sweet.

Ryan looked at Sophie, shrugged and laughed. Sophie noticed the way Ryan tilted her head back slightly when she laughed, her bright smile and smooth skin juxtaposed beauitfully with The Hold Up strobe lights moving around them. She realized their hands were still together and without thinking she lifted their joined hands and spun Ryan around. Ryan must have been caught off guard because she stumbled slightly before Sophie steadied her by guiding her hips. For a second they just stood there, embracing and staring at each other. Ryan’s evocative eyes once again held so much feeling, confusion, questions–lust?

The intro to Go There With You started playing from the speakers and Sophie raised her eyebrows and leaned in barely a whisper from Ryan’s waiting ear. “I know this is your song Wilder, let’s see what you’ve got.” She stepped back a little and motioned for Ryan to start dancing.

'Cause I don't really wanna go there with you

W e picking fights like it's Fortnite
I don't wanna go there with you
Let's end the night on a good time

Ryan’s sudden uneasiness was still there for a moment before quickly being replaced by her incessant need to prove a point to Sophie. She met Sophie’s eyes confidently with a smirk of her own, “Ms. Moore, be careful what you wish for..”

Ryan started moving her body rhythmically, grabbing Sophie’s hands to pull her in closer. The taller woman let out a barely audible gasp of surprise at the warmness of Ryan’s body so close to her own–standing still while Ryan seamlessly in front of her.

I can find a better way to be all in your face

A better way to scream your name, baby
I would rather go there with you
Go there with you

Ryan chuckled, “I’m not going to put on a show for you in front of all these people, so you’re going to have to dance with me.” The flirtatious grin on Ryan’s face practically melted any of Sophie’s apprehension away.

She found her Sophie Freakin Moore confidence and spun Ryan around, pulling her completely into her so that there was little space separating the two.

I can find a better way to be all in your face

A better way to scream your name, baby
I would rather go there with you
Go there with you

When Ryan looked up to meet Sophie’s eyes she was taken aback by the way the room light hit her magical amber colored eyes. They sparkled differently tonight, carrying messages of desire and want. And Ryan felt a flutter in her stomach as those pools bore into her.

Sophie looked down at her own hands on Ryan’s hips, somewhat in awe of finally being in this proximity to the object of her desires– possessively pulling her closer even closer so as not to have even a breath of space between them while they moved to the beat of the night.","<div class=""page"" title=""Page 7"">

They’ve got this.” They take a step forward in line as a kid runs away with a Spongebob popsicle that looks like someone assembled it in the dark. The placement of the blue gumballs as eyes is–nightmarish, to say the least and, on top of that, the teeth .

“Thanks, Sophie, you held in there, and I am proud of you; maybe I can make a professional bowler out of you.” Ryan says with a cute smile on her face.




“You did not just reference Mulan in bowling.” Sophie says, laughing at Ryan’s goofiness.
“She’s one of my favorite Disney characters, sue me.” Ryan says, still in Sophie’s arms.
“She’s mine too, and I am shocked by our scores. You got 260, and I got 195. Jordan and I need to perfect our skills because I need to see you play Jordan.

"Cupid","Sam Cooke","Rene Hall","","","Sam Cooke, Rene Hall","Kupid Killer","As she continues to make her way through the mountain of case files, an unassuming man working as a janitor, fitted with heart shaped retro headphones exits the elevator on the same floor as Sophie. Confident that he is alone, the janitor begins to sing Sam Cooke , “Cupid, draw back your bow. And let your arrow go. Straight to my lover's heart for me, for me. Cupid please hear my cry…”




BOOM!




The mountain of case files from Sophie’s desk falls to the ground causing the janitor to look up in shock. He slides his headphones off and races over towards the noise.




“I’m so-sorry ma’am. I didn’t know anyone was still here.”




Sophie finally looks up at the janitor and he is gobsmacked, enamored by her beauty as she says “Oh no, sir. That is completely my bad. I’m not supposed to be here. My ah, Ms. Jett asked me for a last minute favor. Please don’t let me disrupt your flow”




With that, the janitor and Sophie share a laugh and he begins helping Sophie pick up the files that have fallen on the ground. The janitor begins humming the Sam Cooke and Sophies offers the lyrics this time “there’s danger of me losing my happiness. For I love a girl who doesn’t know I exist..”




The janitor is blushing now as Sophie continues to sing. Once all the files are put back on her desk, she goes back to working and the janitor awkwardly walks away, but quickly changes his mind and goes back over to Sophie’s desk. “H-h-how d-d-do you know that s-s-s-song?”




Sophie smiles as she thinks back to a childhood memory “My father used to sing it to my Mother, when I was younger”




“N-n-nice” the janitor struggles to say. There is a pregnant pause as he searches for something more to say in a desperate attempt to keep Sophie’s attention.

Ryan Wilder emerges from the bedroom looking like a sexual goddess! Lush and loose curls fall down the nape of her neck as the candle light gives her hair a halo effect. A light beat on her face, with curled lashes, and a red lip that she keeps slightly parted makes her look like a flawless sensual painting. Her attire is a two piece black lace lingerie set that she dawns with a tiny red satin robe. I don’t know if her beauty is the result of the devil or an angel, but one thing is certain, Ryan Wilder is out of this world sexy and beautiful!




She gives herself a once over and looks around the loft, she is ready! Anticipating Sophie’s arrival, Ryan unlocks the front door and turns up the music. Silk, “If you” begins playing and that is clearly her song as she lets out an enthusiastic yell of “Baby! I am so ready for you!” And begins singing along.

“Now at my prom, they were playing all the old 90s throwbacks because they refused to play anything that was actually in at the time.…” Ryan said as SWV’s I’m So Into You, started to play from her Homepod.

Sophie narrowed her eyes on her. “What are you doing?”

“Dance with me?” She held her hand out to Sophie.

“Ryan if you don’t go ahead…” She chuckled and playfully swatted her hand away.

“I’m serious, come on, indulge me. Dance with me Sophie….please.” The softness behind her please and the cute way she swayed her hips to the beat made it almost impossible for Sophie to decline her request.

Sophie reached up and allowed Ryan to pull her up off the couch. A part of her felt silly but she liked it. Ryan had such a light and carefree energy that was magnetic. You wanted to be silly with her and just be in the moment.

I’m so into youuuuu

Ryan mouthed the words as she playfully pointed at Sophie. She danced around her, just wanting Sophie to have fun and get out of her head for a while. Sophie watched her closely, eyeing the silhouette of her body and the alluring smile she held on her face. Ryan took Sophie by the hands to lift them up and force her to dance with her but Sophie went a step further and ended up pulling Ryan into her. The move closed all the space that was between them and forced Ryan to look up and match Sophie’s gaze.

There were no words other than the lyrics of the song that had now been drowned out in the background. Sophie thought about how terrible she felt when she first got to Ryan’s place and how good she felt at that moment. For anyone that knew her, getting her out of her feelings was no small thing and somehow in a short amount of time Ryan had managed to do this on multiple occasions. In ways she had yet to discover, she could already feel Ryan was special.","<p>Sophie watched as Ryan picked her phone and shuffled through a list on her phone.</p>

“What do you now about that? I’ve had that album on repeat since it dropped.” Sophie nodded.

“Oh yeah? She’s my favorite artist. I’m such a huge fan girl. Her music has really gotten me through some things.” Ryan said as she looked up at Sophie.

There was a sad look in Ryan’s eyes that Sophie didn’t miss after Ryan spoke. Her eyes fell deep like she was still hurting over something very recent.

Sophie immediately changed the direction of the convo. “Same girl. Look at you having taste in music. Looks like you passed the Bluetooth vibe check.” Sophie smiled.

Ryan smiled picking up on Sophie’s attempt to change the topic and appreciating the older woman for it. Ryan knew Sophie was at least 6 years older than her but damn she did not look it at all. She was tall and fit like she worked out often.

"Can We Talk","Tevin Campbell","","","","Tevin Campbell","Lean on Me","The sound of Tevin Campbell singing Can We Talk drew Sophie to the kitchen after finishing up her work. When Sophie arrived downstairs, Phillipe and Jordan were in the kitchen, the two were cooking and dancing together. Sophie had never seen Jordan so happy to be in a man’s company that she wasn’t just trying to take home and kick out before morning. So it was so refreshing to see. How was she missing all of this? If she was really honest with herself. Her relationship with Kate had consumed all of her time and what little time she had was poured into her work and spending time with Jordan. Mary was out of the country for work and she got away with Facetime and phone calls with Luke when they could. She really was missing so much and it immediately made her sad.

Sophie decided she was taking the week off to really start putting things in motion. She would catch up on the messages and voicemails on her business phone and would call Mary and Luke to catch them up. One of the reasons Sophie loved Luke so much was because he always waited until Sophie was ready to talk. For as long as she could remember he was always a soft place for her to land.

Phillipe spotted Sophie, shuffled over and grabbed her and started dancing with her. He spun and twirled her in Jordan’s direction as she did the same to her sister in tune with the music. It was almost 7 in the evening, Sophie didn’t notice how long she was held up in Ryan’s study working. Jordan and Phillipe were half way through a bottle of wine and as Jordan and Sophie danced, Phillipe poured Sophie a glass which she took with glee.","<p>The sound of <strong>Tevin Campbell</strong> singing <strong>Can We Talk</strong> drew Sophie to the kitchen after finishing up her work.

""You stole my moment you know? I was supposed to kiss you."" Sophie did just that, pressing a light, quick kiss to her lips. 

""Are you really complaining?"" She raised a skeptical eyebrow. 

Sophie chuckled and kissed her lips again. ""No, but only because that move was so smooth.""

""Yeah well maybe because you're so short but it was more on my lips that at my nose."" She couldn't help but tease a little. 

Ryan swatted her playfully laughing. ""Whatever, you got a kiss from a rose and from me.""

""Isn't that a song?"" Sophie tried to think of the lyrics. 

""Mhm."" She felt her nod against her chest.  

""Babyyyyyy I compare you to a kiss from a rose on the grayyyyy..."" Sophie sang loudly and completely off key.

Ryan shook with laughter. ""Maybe we should leave the singing to Seal.""

Ryan leaned back down to kiss Sophie's lips.

Jordan’s classmate, Nathan,
Jordan’s classmate, Nathan, rushes back into the room just in time for the student to cue up Brandy’s “Sitting Up In My Room” over the speakers. The two of them love Brandy and were obsessed with Brandy as teenagers, watching Moesha, so it seemed appropriate. The students start to dance just as Ryan walks in and stops in the doorway, clearly shocked and surprised about what is going on in her class. She’s even more confused about why Sophie is standing in the middle of the room, looking nervous. Jordan is standing beside Sophie with the biggest smile and sign that Ryan has ever seen, and she knows exactly what’s going on.

“Soph, what’s this?” Ryan asks.

“I told you that you would know when I was asking you to be my girlfriend. I never got to ask a girl I like to a school dance, so I’m asking you, will you be my girlfriend and be my date to chaperone a bunch of children dancing badly and awkwardly.”

Ryan gives Sophie a lighthearted smile that takes over her whole face. She can’t hide the excitement and wonder in her eye as she looks around and takes in the scene. Brandy is playing in the speakers, her kids dancing and barely staying on beat, and the girl she really likes is finally asking her to be her girlfriend and asking her to a corny middle school dance.

“You have to answer her, Miss Ryan,” one of the students, Erica, yells from the other side of the room.

“Of course, I’ll be your girlfriend. It took you long enough to ask, I thought you were going to chicken out, and I would have to ask you.” Ryan steps into Sophie’s personal space, putting on hand on her waist.

“I just wanted it to be perfect,” Sophie speaks low enough that none of the kids can hear her.

Ryan lifts herself onto her tiptoes and kisses Sophie. It’s short and sweet, nothing too much, because she didn’t want to go overboard in front of the kids.

“It was absolutely perfect. The Brandy was a nice touch too,” Ryan speaks against Sophie’s lips.","<p>&ldquo;You got this, sis,&rdquo; Jordan encourages as she watches Sophie stand in the middle of the room fidgeting.

Ryan is pleasantly surprised when Sophie starts rapping the words of the song along with the other people in the room who love the song.

The lake house was two hours away so they had enough time to stop to for coffee and bagels. After their stop they headed on to their destination.

Ryan took Sophie’s aux cord and plugged it into her phone. She found the playlist she wanted to hear and pressed play. A familiar song played through the speakers. Ryan started singing along with the radio and dancing in her seat. She noticed Sophie’s hands loosened up on the steering wheel as she bobbed her head along with the music. Ryan lightly pushed Sophie which caused her to sing softly along with Ryan to the song.

“Oh girl

I will not let it go
Oh, girl

Ryan and Sophie sung along to Tevin Campbell’s “Can We Talk” to the top of their lungs. They sung every ad-lib, every note, every lyric and they laughed and smiled with each other while doing so.

Sophie puts on Normani's Motivation and Ryan laughed nervously as she watched the monitor screen intently trying to get a few moves in. She made the mistake of turning around to watch Sophie. Sophie was currently in her sexy mode and killing Normani's choreography. She was so in her element and didn't even notice that Ryan was staring. Ryan was just swaying left and right at this point, just watching Sophie and drooling.

Omg her athleticism is insane and wait was that a full effortless split. My goodness who the hell is this person and what have they done with Sophie.

Ryan tried her best to put a few moves in but her knees were painfully weak from watching Sophie but her heart was full.

This song somehow seemed longer than the previous one. Was it because Ryan wasn't doing much dancing? The song ended and Sophie high fives Ryan and went for her water bottle, leaving Ryan as tongue tied as ever.

'Omg Normani gets me in the zone, gosh I love her choreography so much, it challenges me', says Sophie out of breath.

'Oh no ma'am, are we gonna talk about what just happened? What the hell was that?'

'Oh, come on Ryan, that was nothing'

'I can't believe that a highly skilled and tactical operative such as yourself can move so gently. The was so much sexiness on display, I need to take a minute '

'Oh'

'Yes, oh'

'Can you please do that again, except this time I'm just gonna intentionally sit here and watch you, if that's okay with you?', Ryan is not sure where that came from.

'Hang on, is thee Batwoman asking me to put on a show for her?'

'No, I'm asking as Ryan. I’m gonna need to see you do that again, please', Ryan spoke softly and sounded like she was pleading.

Sophie grabs a chair and places it in the middle of the small room and gestures for Ryan to take a seat, which she does hurriedly.

'Well since you've asked so nicely', Sophie says as she presses replay on Normani’s Motivation.

Unlike the first time where Sophie was giving a ‘So You Think You Can Dance’ worthy performance, this time she was intentionally performing for Ryan. She made sure to take every opportunity to make eye contact and dance as close to Ryan as possible. Her brain didn't process her body's actions as quickly as they played out. Sophie was lost in Ryan's eyes and Ryan was looking at Sophie like she was the only person in the world. So many thoughts were going through Ryan's head. They both don't know when it happened but before they knew it, Sophie was currently giving Ryan a lap dance and things were escalating. The song ended too quickly for Ryan's liking and Sophie was about to get off Ryan's lap when Ryan spun her around and kissed her hungrily, yet passionately.

They broke off the kiss with Sophie still sitting on Ryan's lap, face to face, never breaking eye contact.

'Sophie I'm-

'Shhh, no need to say anything. Let's just be in the moment and allow ourselves to feel what we're feeling right now for a little while longer, is that okay with you?'

Ryan could only nod before she pulled Sophie in for another passionate, slightly longer and more explorative make out session.

Ryan learnt that Sophie is tough yet gentle, she's passionate and commits to the things she loves. Most importantly Ryan learnt that she liked Sophie and that Sophie liked her back.","<p>Writer's Beginning Notes:</p>

Sophie looked Ryan up and down slowly, Ryan grabbed her hands and moved them from Sophie’s lap to her waist. Ryan slowly straddled Sophie then proceeded to sway her hips back and forth to the music. Sophie was in awe as Ryan was on top of her, she couldn’t take her eyes off of her. Ryan stared down at Sophie as she continued to wine her hips slowly that had Sophie holding on for dear life. In the background the party was hollering and cheering on Ryan but Sophie didn’t hear as she was focused on Ryan and Ryan only. Sophie rubbed her hand down Ryan’s back as she swayed back and forth to the beat of the music. Sophie felt her heart was beating so fast as strong feelings surged through her body, as she wanted to feel every part of Ryan’s body. Her hand brushed across Ryan’s cheek as her body was acting on its own as she had no control on what she was doing. Sophie looked into Ryan’s eyes and realized that this was another moment where she has a chance to kiss Ryan. Last night she couldn’t bring herself to do it but right now she could because everyone already thought they were a couple so she would have a valid reason to kiss Ryan. She was not going to miss this opportunity like she did before. She leaned forward and kissed Ryan quickly…just a peck to see if Ryan would return the gesture. Ryan smirked and then leaned forward and briefly touched her lips with Sophie’s. She did it again just softly touching to make sure she didn’t scare Sophie with the intense motion she was feeling. As Ryan lightly pulled back, Sophie pulled forward connecting their lips for longer moments. She cupped Ryan’s face and leaned her head to the side to deepen the kiss. Ryan moved her hands from Sophie’s waist to lightly grab Sophie’s neck and pulled back to look into the honey brown eyes. She smiled. “Was that for show or was that real?” Ryan asked.

Sophie smiled. “What do you want to be?”

Ryan looked up at her eyes and then back to her lips. “Real.” She whispered.

Sophie smiled. “Then real it is.”","<p>Sophie was the only one out of the loop but she couldn&rsquo;t tell as Aunt Tish was keeping her busy talking to her.

I’ll always remember us this way.

Shout out to Lady Gaga.

...

Sophie takes out her phone and presses play on Lady Gaga's Always Remember Us This Way and reaches out for Ryan’s hand to ask for a dance, who then accepts the invite and so their bodies fall into a natural rhythm as they slow danced. Emotions running high as they have both been waiting for this moment for a painfully long time, over 10 years. They’re holding on to each other, never wanting to let go as they each sob in each other’s shoulders, as their bodies move in unison to the music.

That Arizona sky burnin' in your eyes
You look at me and, babe, I wanna catch on fire
It's buried in my soul like California gold
You found the light in me that I couldn't find

So when I'm all choked up
But I can't find the words
Every time we say goodbye
Baby, it hurts
When the sun goes down
And the band won't play
I'll always remember us this way

Lovers in the night
Poets tryin' to write
We don't know how to rhyme
But, damn, we try
But all I really know
You're where I wanna go
The part of me that's you will never die

So when I'm all choked up
And I can't find the words
Every time we say goodbye
Baby, it hurts
When the sun goes down
And the band won't play
I'll always remember us this way

Oh, yeah
I don't wanna be just a memory, baby, yeah
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo

So when I'm all choked up
And I can't find the words
Every time we say goodbye

When you look at me
And the whole world fades

...

After making it back to Sophie's condo and indulging in a shared epsom salt bath, a massage with Sophie's favorite oils, a good night's sleep, and now bellies full of wings of the vegan and non-vegan variety, Ryan lay in her favorite position - on top of Sophie - as they watched the episode I Love Moesha.

Kim and Hakeem as their I Love Moesha counterparts are preparing to perform for their audition when Ryan gets up and pulls Sophie up with her from the couch. The piano begins to play on the TV and Ryan takes hold of Sophie's right hand before wrapping her left around her waist and and begins dancing as Kim sings.

Let me call you sweetheart
I'm in love with you

Ryan is leading their waltz around the living room as best she can given their height difference and Sophie's laughter. Ryan sings along with Kim as she moves them around the couch and near the balcony where the open curtains display Gotham's skyline against the setting sun.

Let me hear you whisper
That you love me too

Sophie twirls Ryan so Ryan's back is against her chest. She leans down so her lips brush against Ryan's ear as she whispers Hakeem's line in time, ""I love you, too."" Ryan takes in a breath before turning around again. They haven't said that they loved each other yet and though she knows it's part of the scene, hearing Sophie say the words makes her heart skip a beat. And it isn't that she hadn't meant the lyrics when she sang them herself - she definitely had. But Sophie probably thought it was all part of the scene so she continued on and sang her next verse.

Keep the love light glowing
In your eyes so true

She separates from Sophie to break it down like Kim causing Sophie to laugh again. Sophie pulls Ryan into her and Ryan wraps her arms around Sophie's neck before finishing the song, feeling Sophie wrap her arms back around Ryan's waist.

Let me call you sweetheart
I'm in love with you

Sophie leans down and places a tender kiss on the shorter woman's lips. Ryan cups the back of Sophie's head with one hand while she runs her nails softly against the nape of Sophie's neck with the other. Her hand wanders down Sophie's back before finding itself under the older woman's tank top. She feels Sophie smile against her lip as her fingertips graze her side. She discovered that Sophie was ticklish their first night together and doesn't hesitate to exploit her discovery every chance she gets. Sophie grabs her hand before she can complete her tickle assault and brings it in front of her before grabbing Ryan's other hand and doing the same. She kisses her knuckles on each hand before lowering their hands to sway between them. Sophie looks into Ryan's eyes,

""You know I meant it, right?""

Ryan thinks, hopes she knows what Sophie meant, but she needs to hear Sophie say it. She needs verbal confirmation of what she feels in her heart. That her feelings are reciprocated.

""Meant what?""

Sophie steps impossibly closer, the backdrop of Gotham behind them, Moesha still playing in the background. Ryan's brow is furrowed in confusion and Sophie can see the fear in her eyes. The fear that Sophie won't reciprocate her feelings. The fear of feeling something real and blowing it. She'd roll her eyes if she was sure that it wouldn't ruin the moment.

""That I love you. That I'm in love with you, Ryan.""

And there it is.

Sophie can see and feel the tension leave Ryan's body. She brings a hand up to cup Ryan's cheek and Ryan leans into the hold, eyes closed, before looking back up at her love.

""I love you, too, Soph. So damn much.""

The smile reserved solely for Ryan, soft, gentle, loving, graces Sophie's face once more as she brings their lips together again. There's more to say, of course, but later. Sophie walks them towards her bed before lying Ryan down gently. They'll have to rewatch the episodes that continue to play in the background as they spend the rest of the night professing their love for one another verbally and physically, but that's alright.

Ryan is in love with her and they've got the rest of the weekend to themselves. Moesha can wait.

She felt Sophie take a quick sharp breath and then she turned around, swiftly but sensually pressing her ass back into Sophie while pulling the taller woman’s arms around her waist.

What was she assuming about the woman that immediately captivated her?

Even when it's do or die
We could do it baby, simple and plain
'Cause this love is a sure thing

"I Choose You","Kiana Ledé","","","","Kiana Ledé","Party Time","Sophie takes the arm Ryan offers to her and they make their way to the dance floor. As they get on the floor, the orchestra begins to play “I Choose You” by Kiana Lede. Ryan can only smile at the irony of leading Sophie to the floor for this song. The two women find their way to the center of the floor, Ryan pulls Sophie into her body and gently rests her hands on the small of Sophie’s exposed back while Sophie slowly raises her arms to wrap around Ryan’s neck. The women begin to move together to the playing of the song. While moving, Ryan is savoring the feeling of having exposed skin against her hands. She revels in the feeling of how soft Sophie’s skin is. They continue to move and Ryan begins to lightly rub the skin under her thumb. This motion causes Sophie’s breath to hitch. Her skin begins to heat up and tingle with every touch that Ryan applies to her back. Sophie didn’t think that her lapse in steady breathing was that obvious, but then Ryan begins to pull Sophie into her body even tighter. With both women in heels, they are almost eye-to-eye, but for once Ryan has an inch or two on Sophie. Ryan looks at Sophie and says, “many other people have had the chance to touch you, but tell me, Miss Moore, does your body react like this to everyone?” Ryan’s comment challenging Sophie. The two women are so close that their bodies are basically connected and their faces only mere inches apart. Ryan now rearranges her hands a bit lower on Sophie’s back, interlacing her fingers. Again, Sophie's body deceives her, her breath catches again and comes out as a soft gasp. The want between the two women is palpable as the song continues. ","<p>Sophie takes the arm Ryan offers to her and they make their way to the dance floor.

The universe would be flooded now

So Lord I call you today

Please don't pass me by

 

It was a deeply emotional selection veering from the upbeat nature of DJ Blessed and Marquis' song choices but Ryan wanted to showcase the range and tone of Sophie's voice. She needed a song that would let everyone hear the vocal cords that made it possible for her to finally see through the woman’s legal conviction and connect with her personal conviction. The song spoke to a yearning that each possessed— a yearning for different tellings of their own stories, their own humanity. If you can’t see the humanity in another person, it blocks the path to your own healing. ","<p>Ryan and Sophie sang a stripped-down version of the Jamaican Gospel Song&nbsp;<strong><em>Hold My Hands by Glacia Robinson</em></strong>. They delivered a soft R&amp;B treatment to the song. Sophie was the vocal lead while Ryan harmonized with her on the chorus.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>My strength is surely failing</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>As trials come both left and right</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>And in the center, I'm now standing</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Not a trace of hope in sight</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>And if tears were only raindrops</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>The universe would be flooded now</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>So Lord I call you today</em></strong></p>

There was a little friendly banter shared. After the sun had set Uncle Bruce and Uncle Clarence wheeled out some speakers and old skool music flowed through the party. Sophie grabbed Ryan’s hand and pulled her onto the lawn as September by Earth, Wind, & Fire began. Most of the grown folks were up dancing to the music. It felt like they were at a family reunion/cookout. Ryan had never experienced this much joy with family. Finally, Sophie wasn’t hiding from herself and was able to just vibe with the people she loved. Unconsciously, Sophie leaned in and kissed Ryan chastely on her lips. The family again erupted into whistles and clapping. Sophie pulled back, grinning, “I love you, Ryan Wilder.” 

Ryan smirked a little, “I love you too, Sophie Moore.” Ryan could feel Sophie’s steady pulse in her neck. This was it. Sophie Moore was her “Happy Ever After” and she couldn’t ask for Moore.  

“Alright, old folks. I got something to get y’all up,” Uncle Clarence spoke into a microphone. He pressed a button and Get Down On It by Kool & The Gang floated out the speakers. 

Sophie & Ryan joined the Soul Train line that was formed by everyone. The song seemed to be irresistible to even the most fragile and frail knees and backs. Aunt Nancy scooted down the line. Shelly and Thomas hopped down the line never catching the beat. Ernestine and Ramona did their best Kid ‘n Play with Ramona almost knocking Aunt Simone over. When it came time for Sophie & Ryan to go, The Second Time Around by Shalamar was playing. Sophie did the Running Man and Ryan did The Robot. At the end of the line they questioned the other’s dance choice.  Many more songs played including Let’s Groove by Earth, Wind, & Fire, Before I Let Go by Maze featuring Frankie Beverly, as well as I’m Coming Out by Diana Ross. It wouldn’t be an authentic get-together without The Electric Slide by Marcia Griffiths.

Sophie and Ryan moved in sync with the song as Sophie pulled Ryan closer looking down at the shorter woman. Ryan didn’t want to look into Sophie’s eyes because she knew once she did then she would be lost in her light brown eyes. Ryan opted to turn her body so that her back was touching Sophie’s front. Sophie accepted the new position as her arms held Ryan’s waist and her face was buried in neck. Ryan extended her arm behind her to reach around Sophie’s neck to pull her closer. Sophie took that as an invitation to plant light kisses on her neck which caused Ryan’s eyes to drift close to relish the feeling of being kissed. Ryan and Sophie stayed like that for awhile dancing to multiple songs before they both suggested to go home.","<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Sophie and Ryan arrived to Sanctuary and the band was in full swing.

"Nothing Even Matters","Ms. Lauryn Hill","D'Angelo","","","Ms. Lauryn Hill, D'Angelo","Until Then","Sophie stared at the ingredients in front of her as if they were the enemy. She wasn't lying; the recipe she found seemed simple enough, but now that the ingredients were in front of her, she was feeling overwhelmed. 

""Come on, Moore. They're vegetables. How hard can it be to prepare vegetables?""

It turned out that while they were easy to prep, they were even easier to burn in the oven. She'd gotten caught up in finding an outfit for the night when she remembered that she wouldn't technically be seeing Ryan. By the time she realized that, the sweet potatoes had been in the oven too long and were burnt but edible. Luckily, the rest of the vegetables fared much better and the dish was salvaged. 

She grabbed her blanket, phone, and cooler before walking out to the dock, Win trailing behind her. She sat her phone and cooler down before spreading the blanket out for her and Win. She sat and took their dishes out - chicken and rice for Win - and then took the wine and a glass out. She shuffled her playlist and poured a glass of wine before taking her own dish out. As she ate, she imagined that she was sitting with Ryan, hopefully providing her with comfort. Soon enough, the sun was setting as Nothing Even Matters by Lauryn Hill ft. D'Angelo played. Sophie couldn't help but think it was perfect. She said a prayer for Mama Cora and Ryan before packing up her things and taking them back in the house. Win was curled up on the couch next to her as she took out her notepad and pen. 

I wish I could've really been with you tonight. You and Mama Cora were in my heart. As the sun was setting, Nothing Even Matters was playing and I wanted more than anything to be able to kiss you.

I feel…a lot for you, Ryan. Part of me feels foolish for falling for you because how could we even be together?

Ryan gasped at Sophie's note. The previous night, right as the sun began to set, Nothing Even Matters played from her cell phone. Before she passed, her mama stressed to her that nothing was more important than love and sharing one's gifts with the world. She thought that particular song playing while the sun set was a fitting tribute for her and her lessons. Reading Sophie's note made her think that it was more for them than it was for her mama. 

She'd cried while making the Buddha bowl, wishing that she could've been making it for both her and her mother rather than just for herself. It hurt her heart to think of eating her mama's favorite meal without her. But then she thought about Sophie and how she was sharing the same meal by request. How she'd asked Ryan if she could join her in honoring her mama, years apart. She again thought back to her conversation with Luke. 

My mama used to say that love knows no space or time. I'd like to think she's right.","<p>Sophie stared at the ingredients in front of her as if they were the enemy.

Ryan and Sophie both stepped closer in their wedding gowns and kissed passionately and embraced as the crowd cheered on. They smiled at each other as they walked down the aisle hand in hand as Mrs. Wilder-Moore.

After a million pictures that the brides and the wedding party took Ryan and Sophie were ready for the reception to begin so that they could dance with family and each other.

The couple walked inside the ballroom which was turned into their reception as the DJ called out. “Everyone get out your seats and give it up for Mrs. Ryan and Sophie Wilder-Moore.” He said as the crowd cheered. The DJ then went on to play “A Couple of Forevers” by Chrisette Michele.

I see it clear, my heart is here

We got each other, let's take it from there

And if I could, I'd love you a forever at time, oh, oh

What we've been through, no one else knows

'Cause all that matters is how far this goes

And it will go until it starts again, oh

The bright sun shining through Ryan's sheer curtains woke her and she blinked her eyes open. She took in the unfamiliar surroundings and saw Win still asleep in her bed. She felt Ryan's legs tangled with hers and the smaller woman's hand holding tightly onto her shirt.

""Not a dream,"" she said softly to herself. During her wait to meet Ryan, she would dream about what it would be like to wake up with her. Reality proved much better than her dreams. She turned away from the window and sunlight to face Ryan who was still asleep. Ryan shuffled until Sophie was laying on her back and Ryan could lay on top of her, head tucked under Sophie's chin. Sophie was unsurprised to discover Ryan was a koala in disguise. She kissed her forehead before drifting off back to sleep.

She awoke again to the smell of bacon frying and Chaka Khan and Rufus playing in the kitchen. She used the restroom and brushed her teeth before grabbing a fluffy robe she found in Ryan's closet. She followed Ryan's off-key rendition of 'Aint Nobody' to the kitchen where she found her love dancing and singing to the music. Sophie looked at the spread on the counter: sweet potato pancakes, eggs, bacon, vegan sausage, and a fruit salad. Ryan had just removed the last piece of bacon from the pan when she turned around and startled at finding Sophie in the kitchen.","<p>During the night, their positions changed and Ryan ended up holding Sophie.

As she listens to the song she finds her thoughts drifting through all the people she’s ever loved. Until…




'Baby while we’re young we should just have fun. We should just do whatever we want and tell everyone that we feel in love with each other. Ooh that we found one in another.'




Suddenly her thoughts shift to her girlfriend who brings light to her life. One filled with happiness, warmth, and love. Before Ryan, her life had been pleasantly boring. She was almost always content and in control. She didn’t lash out too much. Cry too much. Smile too much. Or laugh too much. Because there was no passion in her life. Married to a man she doesn’t even love made her an easy-to-please wife. Tyler was great but he wasn’t what she wanted so she never held high expectations. And she liked being a crow… but even she wasn’t totally blind to their corrupt ways. Besides they were the ones to help shove her in the closet even deeper than before.




But then Ryan re-entered her life and now she has a job she loves. That makes her feel things even if it’s so much frustration she could cry. And she has a girlfriend and a passionate relationship that makes her feel whole. She has friends and chosen family to replace the ones she lost since coming out and her life has never been brighter. Sure she has her struggles like everyone else but Sophie isn’t just going through the phases of life anymore. She’s living them.




With these thoughts in mind she’s all that more eager to reach her girlfriend and show her just how much she appreciates her.

Ryan danced her hands across Sophie’s face each creating equal but opposite reactions against her skin. Encircling each other, hands gliding across and around, settling, instinctively, at the womb’s wall. 

“All I knew,” in  a soft whisper, the words lifted from Sophie’s voice, “This morning when I woke Is I know something now, know something now I didn't before,” Her back turned, Ryan rested on Sophie embracing the woman singing at the waist, “ And all I've seen, since eighteen hours ago are brown eyes and freckles and your smile in the back of my mind making me feel like,” Ryan kissed Sophie’s back, her shoulder, “I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now, I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now, I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now, I just wanna know you, know you, know you,”

The two women giggled releasing so much of the anxiety from their veins. Sophie turned around to face Ryan.

“Did not have singing Taylor Swift in the shower on my bingo card?”

“Did you have singing Taylor Swift on your bingo card?”

“Also, no” 

“Swift is a go-to for the prison glee and impromptu jam sessions in the cafeteria,” Ryan looked at Sophie in disbelief.

“Now, you’re just making things up.” 

“Of all the lies to tell. Why would I tell one as unbelievable as the women of the Freeland Correctional Facility like to get down to some Taylor Alison Swift?” 

“Okay babe, your Taylor knowledge is beginning to scare me. Are you a swiftie?” 

“Mmm… I don’t think we’re there yet,” Ryan released one of those laughs that pump through your heart and out to the world, “your laugh is something pretty magical.” There was a glint in her eyes; it drew Sophie in.

“Do you need a hug first?” Ryan didn’t want to force it on her if that’s not what she needed right now, although all she wanted to do was wrap her up in her arms and let her know that everything would be okay. She nodded again and immediately sobbed into the crook of Ryan’s neck when she scooped her up off the chair and settled her on her hip. She swayed them back and forth allowing Alaia the chance to release all of the tears that she had been trying to hold back. Ryan rubbed her back and kissed her forehead, providing her all the comfort she possibly could.

When she felt her exhale that deep shuddering breath, the one that let her know she was beginning to settle and relax, she started singing softly a song that Mama Cora used to sing to her when she was upset and needed to just be held. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align=""center""><strong><em>You are my sunshine</em></strong></p>
<p align=""center""><strong><em>My only sunshine</em></strong></p>
<p align=""center""><strong><em>You make me happy</em></strong></p>

<p align=""center""><strong><em>You&rsquo;ll never know dear</em></strong></p>
<p align=""center""><strong><em>How much I love you</em></strong></p>
<p align=""center""><strong><em>Please don&rsquo;t take</em></strong></p>
<p align=""center""><strong><em>My sunshine away</em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When Ryan finished the first part of the song, she felt Alaia lift her head and turned to meet her glassy eyes. &ldquo;What song is that is, mama?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>She smiled at her and wiped some lingering tears from her cheeks. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s called&nbsp;<em>Y<strong>ou Are My Sunshine</strong>.&nbsp;</em>It&rsquo;s a song Mama Cora used to sing to me when I was sad or upset.

It takes until the end of the song for Ryan to finally catch up, and Sophie turns around so that she's facing Ryan again. Then, the next song comes on, and it happens to be one of her favorite songs from a duo she recently discovered while she had a Spotify playlist on shuffle. 




Slick baby hair how you do that there

Pose in the mirror how you do that there

Splits in the air how you do that there 

Girl it's not fair how you do that there 




Sophie grooves along the beat of the song, moving her hips and occasionally looking over her shoulder to make sure she's cognizant of the skaters around her. Luckily, Sophie is carving out a path for Ryan because she only has eyes for Sophie right now. In her mind, it is only her and Sophie alone in the rink as she watches her girlfriend's body effortlessly navigating between dancing and skating like a pro. 




Know your ex walking back like Mike Jack

You can bite me girl I bite back




Ryan looks at Sophie with a raised eyebrow, and Sophie laughs because they both know how true those lyrics are for both of them, especially Sophie. Ryan has the bruises and marks to prove that Sophie is 100% a biter, but she would never complain because she loves it. The bruises never really get a chance to fade without Sophie putting them back there. It's her own subtle and private way of claiming her territory, especially on Ryan's thighs. Ryan has her own bad habit of leaving bite marks on Sophie's neck herself; Sophie has to always make sure she has makeup on hand to cover up Ryan's marks. It wouldn't look good or professional for the Head of Security of Wayne Enterprises to leave the CEO's office covered in bruises. 

Sophie grabs Ryan's hands and maneuvers the two of them so that she can spin Ryan around, then position herself so that Ryan is skating in front of her, and Sophie is right behind Ryan. She isn't touching her, but they are close enough that Ryan's body might as well be nestled against Sophie's. 




Ooh the way you wearing that maxi

Them legs looking like a athlete 

Body a Marvel like Shang Chi

Running the city like a track meet

Baby that booty don't need no enhancers

Back in the day she was a dancer 

She could do the high heels or the answers




Ryan jumps when she feels Sophie grab her ass as Sophie sings about booty enhancers. She looks over her shoulder at Sophie's teasing and mischievous smile. It is no secret that one of Sophie's favorite parts of Ryan is her butt. Any time Ryan is lying in bed on her stomach, Sophie uses that opportunity to use her butt as a pillow. She has taken many naps like that or cuddled up with Ryan, her arms wrapped around her and cupping one cheek for comfort. It is a weird way to sleep, but Ryan doesn't mind it as long as she gets to be close to Sophie, and she has her own weird sleeping habits, so she can't judge.




I thinking she wanting me

She a freak and she oughta be

<p>...</p>
<p align=""justify"">&ldquo;Hey Soph&rdquo; Ryan said quietly, waiting for eye contact before she continued, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got this.&rdquo;</p>
<p align=""justify"">Sophie laughed, remembering Ryan had provided that exact reassurance before their first dance. Even after she&rsquo;d been borderline rude to her that whole first week. Knowing they had about thirty seconds before the soundtrack would kick in Sophie bent down and kissed Ryan. As they kissed Ryan put her hand on Sophie&rsquo;s hip and the want of everything that could have happened that morning rushed back. The stage hand counted them in and the announcer said, &ldquo;Dancing the Rumba to <strong>Cherry by Fletcher and Hayley Kiyoko</strong>, Ryan and Sophie&rdquo;</p>
<p align=""justify"">It was easy enough to slip back into the starting pose of the dance, Ryan&rsquo;s hand on the back of Sophie&rsquo;s neck. Looking into each other&rsquo;s eyes, standing only an inch apart. It was supposed to look like the viewers were interrupting something. In the opening bars of the song Ryan moved her other hand up and Sophie dipped her down, Ryan took advantage of being close to Sophie to say, &ldquo;Pretend it&rsquo;s just us, before we got interrupted this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p align=""justify"">And fuck if Ryan didn&rsquo;t deserve the dance of Sophie&rsquo;s life. After all she was doing to support her in getting over their nerves. She needed an amazing dance to keep them in the competition, she wasn&rsquo;t ready for this to be over. With a renewed intensity Sophie leaned into the desire she&rsquo;d felt that morning and focused on channeling that into the dance. She knew the choreography was some of her best, and they both knew the steps. All she had to do was sell the emotion and this would be the best dance for them yet.</p>
<p align=""justify"">With that as her final thought the music washed over Sophie. &nbsp;She closed out everything but the way Ryan&rsquo;s hands on her felt and lost herself in the lyrics as she danced. Her body flowing away from Ryan&rsquo;s then pulling her back in close. Feeling Ryan&rsquo;s curves as she placed her hands back on her girlfriend. The Rumba steps alternated dancing hip to hip, the closest thing you&rsquo;d see in this ballroom to grinding in a club, before swaying back out. The choreography ensuring the close moments and any touches were a fleeting tease. The routine took them across the dance floor, adding spins and staccato moments where they looked into each other&rsquo;s eyes. For the beats they locked eyes Sophie could see Ryan&rsquo;s desire. Could feel her own escalate in response.</p>

You got me open like the wallet of a big spender

We should do it again and again

And if we get married I won't leave, oh no

Believe me I will do you right

I'll show what I'll do

It's not about what I say, no

My focus is on you

I won't leave no way, no no no

Let me love you nice and slow

I'll introduce you to some things you ain't

Things you ain't never felt before




The dark stage is lit up by red lights which are bouncing of off Ryan and her backup dancers.

Ryan’s waist dip to the ground and she whines her way back up her eyes solely focusing on Sophie’s, who is watching at the side of the stage.




Cause my love is thorough

My love is thorough

My love is thorough, thorough, thorough

My love is thorough

You don't get high

But you gon' touch the sky tonight.

For Ryan to be a photographer she rarely posted photos of her work or anything of that nature but she kept the picture of her and Sophie on her Instagram which Sophie stared at and analyzed the entire time she was at the award show that she almost missed her name being called.

Luke lightly pushed her to get her attention. “Sophie you’re up.” He said. Sophie smiled at him and then got up from the table to accept her award.

Growing up I always wanted to be a change in this world to make an impact in some sort of way or fashion. Whoever would have thought that words would be that change. The pen between my hands as I scribbled down my feelings, my thoughts, my opinions had become my relief at times that I didn’t know I needed. Now today as I accept this award I am extremely grateful for becoming the change that you all see. I want to thank my family, the Gotham Community, the Gotham Gazette, my friends special shout-out to Luke and Tish who always stayed by my side through it all and to Ryan.

"One Last Dance","John Legend","","","","John Legend","The Affair","John Legend’s voice started to play from the speakers. Sophie put out her hand to Ryan, palm up in question. Ryan placed her hand in Sophie's, as Sophie guided them onto the floor. They threaded their fingers as they made their way to the dance floor, carving out a place among the couples.

When that melody plays, and I see your face, the memories race right back to me.

Sophie placed Ryan’s hand on her back while she held the other in her hand to lead them both. She smiled down at Ryan as Ryan looked up at her.

Is it wrong to reminisce? Is it wrong to steal a kiss? Is someone waiting for you at home? Tonight, could be the only night. A fleeting glimpse, what could we might’ve been if we had never let go?

Ryan moved closer into Sophie. Resting her cheek against her chest. Feeling the beat of her heart. Ryan sighed as she felt as though she could finally breathe easily. Sophie leaned her head down so that it was resting on top of Ryan’s as she gently swayed them.

Oh, when that melody plays, I whisper your name, I want you to stay right next to me. And I hope you give me one last dance. Head on my shoulder, like it ain’t over. Oh, this moment gave us one more chance. Why don’t we hold it before the bar closes?

Ryan pulled back so that her face was only inches away from Sophie as they spun in a circle. Neither breaking eye contact. The rest of the patrons were just invisible figures. Nobody else existed. Sophie looked down at Ryan’s lips as Ryan pulled Sophie’s face down into a kiss. They pulled back after a moment. Both regarding the other, before they smiled and dived back into the kiss.

Song - John Legend, One Last Dance.","<p><strong>John Legend</strong>&rsquo;s voice started to play from the speakers. Sophie put out her hand to Ryan, palm up in question. Ryan placed her hand in Sophie's, as Sophie guided them onto the floor. They threaded their fingers as they made their way to the dance floor, carving out a place among the couples.</p>

"Crush","Yuna","USHER","","","Yuna, USHER","As I Am","“This is everything you’re worthy of,” she leaned over to Sophie giving her a kiss before lying down on a pillow a little bit higher up positioning herself for Sophie to snuggle into her side. She curled into Ryan’s right side, the shorter of the two women pulling the taller into her chest, wrapping her arms around her, and kissing her crown. “Star-gazing and cloud watching or nature movie as my mama called it,” Ryan pointed to a group of stars in the sky, “look. See over there, if you look at the star at the bottom and move across to the other, it almost looks like a guy standing at a microphone. Who do you think it is? What song is he singing?”

Sophie felt her eyes becoming teary. Every moment with Ryan reached a new part of her. She had never been treated this way before— the serenity wasn’t just surrounding them; it was between them and within them, “So the nature movie is telling stories about the stars in the sky.”

“Yea, and the clouds. We would come out here with enough time to stay up for the sunrise and the clouds dancing into the morning. You think it’s silly?”

Sophie sat up slightly so she could look Ryan in the eyes, “No, never that. I think it’s the most beautiful thing I have ever been a part of. I just. I have a hard time wondering if you’re real. Everything with you is just…Ryan, I feel so many of the things that I willed myself to never feel again with you.” 

Ryan listened to Sophie while playing with the mahogany-skinned woman’s hair. She wondered who left the shrapnel on her heart. Who left playing this game of ‘retreat from love’? Each time they had carved out a space where Sophie was the center she came back to this moment. 

“You’re afraid of being hurt in a way you haven’t explained to me and I am not asking you to do that now. Our feelings often run at a pace faster than our minds and sometimes I have to choose which one to listen to. I’ve been hurt too. Three first dates: a big romantic experience I came up with to protect myself from the worst possible outcome. If she ran away, at least, I know it wasn’t on the first attempt. What do you call that? Dark romance?” She breathed in, stroked the side of Sophie’s face hoping that the beauty staring back at her could stop the tears from rushing forth but they did anyway, “the last woman I held in my arms left and I don’t know why. She disappeared. A part of me could shut in but then that would mean she took me with her; I can’t let that happen.”

Sophie wiped the tears from Ryan’s face and kissed each eye before placing a gentle kiss on the tearful woman’s lips, “I think the song is Crush by Yuna and I really like this movie,” Ryan smiled back.","<p>&ldquo;This is everything you&rsquo;re worthy of,&rdquo; she leaned over to Sophie giving her a kiss before lying down on a pillow a little bit higher up positioning herself for Sophie to snuggle into her side.

They’d been lucky to get to dance to Beyoncé again this season. She’d had even managed to incorporate some nods to ball culture into the little flourishes of the choreography.

<p>From start to finish the song went perfectly, Ryan&rsquo;s frame was amazing. Sophie appreciated Ryan&rsquo;s acting ability making the tension they needed for the Paso routine so believable. Sophie knew her acting hadn&rsquo;t been awful. She didn&rsquo;t even break into her I&rsquo;m lovesick for you look for Ryan when they were forehead to forehead, spiraling around each other. Sophie knew she only broke her serious expression once. She couldn&rsquo;t help it when heard Jordan cheer at a particularly cool stunt, where Sophie kicked out over the top of a kneeling Ryan&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>Sophie had done her best to add as much flair as she could with no lifts. Midway through the dance she dipped Ryan into the splits and the flashy finish was her dropping down onto her knee, lowering Ryan quickly across her lap. &nbsp;As the crowd applauded Sophie looked down at Ryan, a satisfied smirk both at the performance and view right down Ryan&rsquo;s low cut dress.</p>

Ryan smiles at Sophie, hands on her cheek.

Sophie begins to sings voice a little shaky.




It's in the moments when you're left all on your own

And it hits you from out of nowhere

You try to hide it sometimes unsuccessfully

With a smile that fades quickly

Sophie continues singing through her shaky and flat vocals.

Singing the next verse and looking at no one except Ryan.




You're resistance to sadness is futile but

You're a fighter, can't stand defeat

You're a magician at hiding the hurt from you

But I see and I hear you

Loud as a bomb

Wanting a shoulder to cry on

I hear you

Tumbling fast




Ryan stands and walks to the stage accompanying Sophie vocals as she hears some groans and murmurs in the restaurant.

Here and now, you're afraid

Don't be scared

Don't be scared




Ryan joins Sophie on the stage hands reaching for hers. Eyes closing as she belts out the next verse.

Cause I hear you

Loud as a bomb

Wanting a shoulder to cry on, I hear you




Ryan continues to get lost in the song , releasing Sophie’s hand and grips the mic, rendering the restaurant silent. Sophie steps back to the side of the stage to take in Ryan fully.

I see the way that you look when you hear his name

I see his picture up in your frame

And you refuse to admit you still miss him but it's okay

You're a tower of strength when you're breaking down

But through the wall I can feel your cry

And when it's quiet you're screaming inside

And I break as I hear you

Loud as a bomb

Wanting a shoulder to cry on




Ryan opens her eyes and finds Sophie’s both of their eyes filling with tears.

I hear you

Tumbling fast

Here and now, you're afraid

Don't you worry

I'll teach you to fly before you fall away




The restaurant erupts in applause and a standing ovation.

Ryan step off the small stage lips immediately finding Sophie’s and hands circling around her waist.

Sophie: “that was beautiful Ryan” hands moving to wipe the tears from Ryan’s face.

She leans into Sophie’s touch. “ thank you”

Before the kiss could get too deep, she pulled back and then picked up her phone from where she dropped it on the table. She connected her phone to the room's Bluetooth and Faith Evans' Kissing You began playing throughout the room. She stood up and held her hand out to Ryan who accepted it and stood up with her. Sophie led them to the window with a view of the fountain below and they began dancing to the music.

As the song crescendoed to the bridge, both women felt connected to the lyrics.

"We Might Even Be Falling In Love (Interlude)","Victoria Monét","","","","Victoria Monét","The Long Haul","“See you already like my music and on the first song.” Ryan’s cocky grin widened. 







“How can you

“How can you not love Victoria Monet’s music?” Sophie quipped.







“True, true. Although this one is just the interlude.” The short song ended and transitioned into another song that Sophie didn’t know. 




“Play it again.” A demand. Ryan raised her eyebrows. “Please?” She punctuated her request with a kiss to Ryan’s hand that was still tangled in her own. 




“Wait...are you finally going to sing for me?” Ryan asked, eyes lighting up. 




Sophie sat up and picked up the small remote for the lights. She tapped the top edge and cleared her throat. 




“Is this thing on? Mic check 1, 2. Mic check 1, 2.” Sophie forced her express to remain stoic as Ryan’s laughter filled the car. 




She winked at her roommate, lying next to her with an expectant expression. “This song is dedicated to the hot groupie up front.” She pointed at her, playfully, touching her index finger to the tip of Ryan’s nose. 




Ryan laughed again at Sophie’s goofiness as she wrinkled her nose at the touch. She was ready to hear this infamous singing of hers though. She hit play on the song again and laid back, waiting. 




With her fake microphone in hand, Sophie closed her eyes and sang, making sure she was slightly louder than Victoria so her own voice could be the main focus. 




Go head act a fool in it

Freestyle with me 'til you find your groove in it

Ryan had sat up as Sophie’s voice overtook the small space, beyond impressed at the captivating cadence of her singing. She remained quiet but intent, memorizing the way she closed her eyes and seemed to lose herself in the melody while Ryan lost herself in the lyrics spilling from her roommate’s lips. 

U-haul 'cause I might let you move in it

'Cause I ain't had nobody hit it like you hit it

And it feels likeI'm gonna know you for the rest of my life

It's safe to say that we might even be falling in love

Ooh, love, love, love

Ooh, love, love, love…




Sophie’s voice was beautifully, soulful with just the perfect level of rasp, different to the original artist of the song, but no less impressive. Victoria Monet definitely had at least one thing right, they might be falling in love, or at least Ryan was, even before the singing. But the passion behind Sophie’s voice only made her fall harder in that particular moment.




“Soph…” She didn’t have the words. “Wow.” 




She smiled shyly at Ryan who still sat, practically starstruck. “Speechless huh? Maybe, I should sing more often. Midargument perhaps? That way I’ll actually get a chance to speak and make my point.”

Tell your best friend (s)he can slide too

“It’s not that,” she said miserably. “He’s spending time with his best friend tonight. Apparently this is her last night in the city for a while.”

“Girl.” Ryan stared at her with a blank expression. “The solution is so simple.”

“What?”

“Tell him his best friend can slide too.” She said it like it was the most obvious thing in the world.

[01:13 AM] Ryan❤️: yeah I know bc i’m one of the people who missed you but you always going on and on🙄😒

Ryan bit her lip, wondering if what she wanted to say next was too much or not. Then she said fuck it and sent the message, ‘Mama ain’t raise no bitch’ mindset and all that.

[01:13 AM] Ryan❤️: call off your plans for me😂

Immediately after she pressed send, she put the phone face down on the bed and distracted herself with brushing her teeth. She needed to do something to calm her nerves after such a risky text. She finished up in the bathroom and turned off all the lights. When she picked up her phone, she had to do a double take.

Ryan quirked an amused eyebrow at her friend’s contemplative look. It honestly wasn’t that deep. “You can ask, Mary.”

“What happened with things between you and Sophie?”

“Nothing,” Ryan groaned. “That’s the point. I’m sick of the back and forth, the ‘will we won’t we’ of it all. I think I deserve a nice night out with someone other than my friends. I ain’t did that in a minute.”

“Okay that’s fair,” Mary said softly. “But have you stopped to consider that maybe the reason she hasn’t asked you out is because you rejected her the first time?”

“Wait, did Sophie say that? Is that really how she feels?” Mary looked panicked. Being best friends for years meant that they knew how to read each other. Ryan already had her answer, but she needed verbal confirmation. But before Mary could respond, her phone started to ring.

Ryan felt Sophie’s breath on her neck and her skin pimpled. A woman hadn’t pulled this type of reaction out of her in a while.

Next song was T-Pain’s “Low” Ryan turned around and Sophie threw it back on her. Ryan was a little short for Sophie’s movements with her ass hitting Ryan in the chest. Sophie could feel this and stopped. She pulled off her heels and tossed them under a nearby table. Now that she was closer to Ryan’s height she could feel more comfortable. Ryan barely grazed her body, however Sophie deliberately grinded her hips and was excited that another woman was sharing her space. It’s not that she never danced with another woman, but she was now out dancing with a very attractive woman who she also knew was out. 

Usher’s “Yeah” came on and Ryan & Sophie faced each other. Sophie’s skin glowed in the blue light. Sweat was beginning to roll down their backs. Ryan was glad she stayed. She & Sophie were going on 3 dances, but who was counting? Sophie looked up and saw Ryan mouth, Come and get me . Ryan bent over and touched her toes. Sophie watched the booty in front of her and stepped forward. 

Next hit was T-Pain’s “Up Down” to which Ryan faced Sophie and got in close. Ryan grinded up into Sophie and when the friction doubled with Sophie bringing herself down both parties closed their eyes at the feeling. A minute later Sophie opened her eyes again and Ryan was still there in the blue light with her hands massaging Sophie’s waist. This was as easy as water running down stream. Ryan hadn’t danced like this in a long time. Sophie felt dampness seeping into her panties. 




Mary and Jordan watched from a table. They’d been peeping the action since the first dance. Both ladies threw back their shots before they continued staring. “Sophie really knows how to have a good time,” Mary said. 




“I’ve never seen her let loose like this. Do you think she’s this drunk off her coming out high?” Jordan wondered.




Mary shrugged, “She hasn’t taken a shot since she got here. She’s drunk off Ryan.” 




Jordan raised her hand, “I’m calling it first. Wildmoore is my new favorite lesbian ship.” 




Mary turned away from the scene to look at Jordan, “Who said they’ll become a couple? It’s Sophie’s first night out. Can you let the girl breathe?” 




Jordan pointed, “The way Ryan is letting her breathe ?” Mary looked back and Ryan was in full twerk as “Salt Shaker '' boomed through the speakers. Sophie was right up behind Ryan grinding on her ass.

Mary’s bottom lip dropped. “All aboard Wildmoore ship.” ","<p>&ldquo;1 dance?&rdquo; Sophie held up her finger.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mary and Jordan watched from a table. They&rsquo;d been peeping the action since the first dance. Both ladies threw back their shots before they continued staring. &ldquo;Sophie really knows how to have a good time,&rdquo; Mary said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never seen her let loose like this. Do you think she&rsquo;s this drunk off her coming out high?&rdquo; Jordan wondered.</p>

<p>Mary shrugged, &ldquo;She hasn&rsquo;t taken a shot since she got here. She&rsquo;s drunk off Ryan.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jordan pointed, &ldquo;The way Ryan is letting her&nbsp;<em>breathe&nbsp;</em>?&rdquo; Mary looked back and Ryan was in full twerk as &ldquo;Salt Shaker '' boomed through the speakers. Sophie was right up behind Ryan grinding on her ass.</p>

Ryan smiles and nods, “1 dance.” 




The 4 came out to the club vibrating to Lil Jon’s “Get Low”. When they were back in the section, Ryan dropped her ass and Sophie followed her. Sophie had never danced with Ryan before, but it was effortless following her movements. As Ryan swayed from left to right and poked out her tush, Sophie felt the fullness. Ryan felt Sophie’s breath on her neck and her skin pimpled. A woman hadn’t pulled this type of reaction out of her in a while.

Next song was T-Pain’s “Low” Ryan turned around and Sophie threw it back on her. Ryan was a little short for Sophie’s movements with her ass hitting Ryan in the chest. Sophie could feel this and stopped. She pulled off her heels and tossed them under a nearby table. Now that she was closer to Ryan’s height she could feel more comfortable. Ryan barely grazed her body, however Sophie deliberately grinded her hips and was excited that another woman was sharing her space. It’s not that she never danced with another woman, but she was now out dancing with a very attractive woman who she also knew was out. 

Usher’s “Yeah” came on and Ryan & Sophie faced each other. Sophie’s skin glowed in the blue light. Sweat was beginning to roll down their backs. Ryan was glad she stayed. She & Sophie were going on 3 dances, but who was counting? Sophie looked up and saw Ryan mouth, Come and get me . Ryan bent over and touched her toes. Sophie watched the booty in front of her and stepped forward. 

Next hit was T-Pain’s “Up Down” to which Ryan faced Sophie and got in close. Ryan grinded up into Sophie and when the friction doubled with Sophie bringing herself down both parties closed their eyes at the feeling.

She was being goofy for no discernible reason that Sophie could tell since any footage of Julia was not usable footage. Channeling her mom, Sophie gave Julia her best withering hurry-up look. Finally, she finished with, &ldquo;&hellip; you&rsquo;re doing a contemporary dance!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Admittedly the reveal was worth it, as an uninhibited Sophie screamed in excitement. She grabbed Ryan, pulling her in for a hug, forcing her to join her in jumping up and down. &nbsp;Even as Ryan laughed at her antics, Julia smiled at them and said sarcastically, &ldquo;Save the antics for when we do a take of this for the cameras!

"We Don't Talk About Bruno","Encanto Cast","","","","Encanto Cast","Meant To Be","“We want to dance to Bruno.” Lily gave a little jump in excitement.

“Yeah, Bruno,” Maya screeched. “Alexis play don’t talk about Bruno.” Maya glanced around the room, like she was waiting for the song to play.

“It’s Alexa and we don’t have one. That’s only at your Aunt Emma’s,” Sophie reminded her daughter. “And how about we dance to something else,” Sophie said. She was all for having a little dance with her girls, but she detested the song ‘we don’t talk about Bruno’. In fact, she didn’t really like Encanto all that much either. “Anything but Bruno.”

“No,” Lily frowned. “Mommy please.” Lily batted her eyelashes at her mother.

Sophie looked down to Lily who was looking up at her, all puppy dog like. “You know I can’t say no to that little face,” Sophie pinched Lily’s cheek. She really wanted to talk to the girls about the divorce but she figured she’d let them have a little fun first. She’d much rather be doing this with Tyler present but he’d made it pretty clear to her that he wasn’t having any involvement in this conversation. “One song because then I want to talk to you, okay?”","<p>&ldquo;We want to dance to <strong>Bruno</strong>.&rdquo; Lily gave a little jump in excitement.</p>

<p>At the sound of the word baby, the rest of the world disappeared. It was Ryan and Sophie in the garden. Rather than walking the runway. Ryan danced through the garden as she sang.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Time a frozen for Sophie Moore and Ryan Wilder. The designer was so tuned in that she missed the moment that the musician touched her. The spotlight follows her from backstage to Sophie&rsquo;s space.&nbsp;</strong></p>

...

Writer's Beginning Notes:

I was in the mood for angst. If you've read some of the dialogue before in this? No you haven't. Songs are Contrasting Colors by Speak Low if you speak love, Dancing With Our Hands Tied by T. Swift, I Found by Amber Run, and Anyone Else by PVRIS in that order. Enjoy!

...

Fall into place like contrasting colors
You were gold, I was green to discover
Swirling like oceans apart from each other
You and I may never be lovers

She had come to know her life would change completely three nights before her eleventh birthday.

The skin above the right hip itched and stung. She could feel the name etch itself into her skin. Like it was being burned in by a laser.

It terrified her.

You weren't supposed to find out the name of your soulmate until you were eighteen years old. Unless, you're soulmate had turned eighteen before you. And sure that was moderately common. If the age gap was no more than like 2 years. But for her it was different.

Ryan knew what that had meant almost immediately. She had always been a precocious kid.

It meant that her mate was seven dang years older than her.

That couldn't be good.

She peered down and peeled the hem of her sleep shorts away from her hip. The name was upside down from her perspective but she read at a 9th grade level and that probably translated to being able to read upside down.

Sophie Diane Moore

Ryan had heard that name before. She's obsessed over that name before. She's read that name's New York Times Bestselling novel over and over again since it hit the shelves two years prior. Sophie Moore had been something of a child prodigy herself.

Ryan frowned. Then pouted. Then she cried. Not only was her soulmate seven years her senior, she was also famous.

She never stood a chance.

The mark you said would last, I'm noticing
It never did

Ryan usually watched Entertainment Tonight with her foster mother on Thursdays at 4 pm. They'd been doing that since Ryan was twelve. She's now fifteen and things haven't changed.

The name above her hip tingled slightly and she shifted.

Her mother reached to change the channel when she noticed the new hot topic being introduced. Ryan waved her off.

It had been a familial (her social worker had also been involved) decision to keep Ryan from having any contact with the author. Ryan, her mother, and her social worker had sat around the dining room table staring at each other for a full five minutes before Cora spoke up and explained their position.

Ryan was too young, Sophie was too....famous.

Ryan didn't really get a say, though, she realized any of her decisions would have been heavily biased considering she's genetically wired to be in love with the woman. And her guardians haven't failed her so far. So, she went along with it.

Even now, it was one of those times when Cora had been right. She quickly realized that preventing her mother from changing the channel was a grave mistake.

""Sh-she has a girlfriend?"" Ryan whispered mainly to herself. Despite her quietness, her mother heard her anyway.

Cora pulled her trembling daughter into her side. ""Do-does she not love me? Does she not want me? D-does she not-""

""Shhhhh, baby. Shhhh."" Ryan does eventually quiet down, if anything to better hear the sound of her own heart cracking in two.

Ryan watched Sophie happily prance around with her new girlfriend, Kate. Sophie had girlfriends and one boyfriend before and they all pierced her heart with blunt, rusty knives, but this one hurt worse.

She's not sure why.

Would you say that you loved me if you knew I do?
Or is protecting your pride worth more than the truth?
I'm still waiting on something you outgrew

By her eighteenth birthday, Ryan Wilder was over Sophie Moore. Or at least as much as she could be. She had also figured out why it hurt more.

It hurt more because now they're engaged. But what can she do? Absolutely nothing.

She's made a name for herself. She's successful, just like Sophie.

She's the youngest in her graduating class for law school. And definitely the only queer black woman.

She's got her own office at a prestigious firm and at 21 she's well on her way to make senior partner. She's grateful.

The circumstances are funny, she likes to think.

Swirling like oceans apart from each other
You and I may never be lovers

Two years later, she can buy three beach houses right next to each other on the shore. And she does, simply because she can. One for her. One for her mom. And one just as a fucking backup.

She's never been closer to Sophie in years, and she wouldn't dare get any closer.

Because Sophie pretends her name isn't written across her left hip in bright red ink. Like she hasn't been branded for life. Because Sophie pretends Kate Kane is her soulmate. Because Sophie pretends she doesn't exist.

Ryan knows Sophie's favorite color is gold and her own is green (those colors don't fit together), she knows Sophie's afraid of thunderstorms and Ryan loves them (maybe that isn't exactly compatible), she knows that they don't fit and Sophie is happy without her.

And that's fine with Ryan, if Sophie wants to boast about how good her life is without her, then so can she.

And Ryan can boast better.","<p align=""left"">Story Title: <strong>Contrasting Colors</strong></p>

I was in the mood for angst. If you've read some of the dialogue before in this? No you haven't. Songs are Contrasting Colors by Speak Low if you speak love, Dancing With Our Hands Tied by T. Swift, I Found by Amber Run, and Anyone Else by PVRIS in that order. Enjoy!

...

I, I loved you in secret
First sight, yeah, we love without reason
Oh, twenty-five years old
Oh, how were you to know

...

I could've spent forever with your hands in my pockets
Picture of your face in an invisible locket

The only upside to her current predicament was that Luke was with her, looking just as miserable as she felt.

Though, she knew his reason for being miserable had more to do with having to leave Mary to her work duties, than being forced to have fun by his boss.

""God, how did you deal with this growing up?"" Ryan gestured to the general vicinity of the room.

Luke adjusted his black and blue mask then shrugged, ""I mainly stayed by the food tables and played on my gameboy advance. Surprising fact about stuck up rich people? They don't really eat.""

Ryan eyed the room with scrutiny, ""That's not surprising at all.""

Loud waltz music suddenly started playing, indicating a well rehearsed dance that Ryan wasn't in on.

Luke held his hand out with an exaggerated flourish, ""May I have this dance, m'lady?""

Ryan stared at him blankly.

Luke huffed, ""C'mon, Ryan. Dad said you need to have fun and this is the perfect opportunity.""

Ryan's lip twitched, ""I don't know how to waltz.""

""Neither do they."" Luke pointed to a couple clearly in their own world as they happily made up steps with each other. He held out his hand again.

Ryan heaved out a sigh, ""Fine. But I'm leading.""

Luke didn't have time to protest before Ryan was dragging him out onto the dancefloor.

Luke ended up being right. Dancing and goofing off in the otherwise stuffy atmosphere was enjoyable.

That was until she got a tap on the shoulder.

""May I cut in?"" Ryan knew that voice anywhere. Suddenly, she wasn't having fun anymore.

And Luke, that bastard, offered her up with no hesitation.

And there she was, for the first time ever, face to face, or rather mask to mask with her soulmate.

Her senses were heightened. She could feel everything. Hear everything. Smell everything.

She could feel Sophie's hand and everytime it flexed nervously against her hip. She could hear the apphrensive gulp of air Sophie took before speaking. She couldn't smell anything but the Yves Saint Laurent Libre perfume Sophie wore.

It was comically how quickly all that resentment she had spent the last decade of her life building up, just crumbled away.

""Was the misses busy?"" Though, she had managed to maintain the pettiness.

""Ryan..."" Sophie sighed out softly.

""Oh? You know my name?""

""It's only seared into my hip.""

Ryan scoffed, ""Could've fooled me.""

""I deserve that. But, what was I supposed to do Ryan? Wait?""

""Yes! You were supposed to wait for me.""

""Seven years, Ryan. That's-""

""You think I don't know that? I did it. You were supposed to sit there and be miserable like I have for the past 16 years."" Ryan poked Sophie in the shoulder.

""I'm sorry, Ryan. I really am, but would you just listen to me?"" And to her credit, Sophie sounded genuinely upset and apologetic, but Ryan couldn't have even begun to listen even if she wanted to. She was just mad.

""Did she leave you? Did she finally realize you would never truly be happy with her? She did she finally grow curious about who was tattooed to her own body? Does it suck to be alone?""

""You were a kid, Ryan!"" Sophie looked as though she wanted to pull her hair out. Welcome to Ryan's world.

""I'm 27, Sophie. I haven't been a kid for a while."" They were no longer dancing. They hadn't been for a while. Just standing in the middle of a sea of spinning amd twirling couples like two lunatics.

""What are you saying? You won't hear me out. You won't see things from my perspective. So, what do you want me to do? Do you want me to leave you alone?""

Ryan's eyes narrowed, she didn't want any of those things in the slightest.

She wanted Sophie to do what she herself couldn't. She wanted Sophie to scream and fight for her and get it through her thick skull that despite wanting all those things it was going to take Ryan a while before she could truly forgive her.

She wanted to fall into Sophie's arms and tell her about the past twenty-seven years that she had missed. She wanted to introduce Sophie to her mom and to overhear her mom threaten Sophie if she ever put Ryan through something like waiting for her for sixteen years again.

She just wanted Sophie.

And yet, for some reason, none of that left her mouth. In its place, just a huff of air. And a insincere apology as she hightailed it out of that damn gala.

If I could dance with you again
I'd kiss you as the lights went out
Swaying as the room burned down
I'd hold you as the water rushes in

Instead of taking off a week, Lucius had added another. And hell, Ryan couldn't blame him.

She felt like she had gotten run over by a steamroller.

Seeing news of Sophie's divorce in the tabloids did nothing to make her feel better.

Luke and Mary occasionally popped over to her apartment, separately because they thought being together would throw her into a fit if hysterics.

Cora also occasionally appeared mysteriously in her apartment from time to time when she got that mother instinct thing that Ryan wasn't eating as much as she should. Slipped in her Tupperware containers were subliminal messages that suggested she get over herself and talk to Sophie.

She didn't listen.","<p align=""left"">Writer's Beginning Notes:</p>

"I Found","Amber Run","","","","Amber Run","Contrasting Colors","Writer's Beginning Notes:

I was in the mood for angst. If you've read some of the dialogue before in this? No you haven't. Songs are Contrasting Colors by Speak Low if you speak love, Dancing With Our Hands Tied by T. Swift, I Found by Amber Run, and Anyone Else by PVRIS in that order. Enjoy!

...

I'll use you as a warning sign
That if you talk enough sense then you'll lose your mind
And I'll use you as a focal point
So I don't lose sight of what I want

The knock at her door caused her to just about out of her skin. She wasn't expecting anyone. And those who were allowed to not be expected had a key.

""Ryan?"" The voice called through the door. And Ryan abruptly stopped reaching for the knob to open it.

""How'd you find me?""

Sophie chuckled out something so warm that Ryan had the urge to turn on the air conditioning.

""Friends in high places.""

""Figures.""

""You're really not going to open the door? Fine. I didn't think actually you'd open the door. That's fine. I'll just yell through it."" She chuckled to herself.

Ryan paused. She didn't move further from the door, but she didn't get any closer either.

""You were right, y'know? About Kate. At least partially. She did realize that I would never be able to truly give her my all. No matter how hard we tried to pretend. She doesn't have a soulmate, though.""

Ryan remained quiet. Content to finally listen to Sophie.

""I guess we just thought it would make sense to force it. To settle down with each other because it was easier. Neither of us had to suffer that way...""

Ryan heard a small thud around where Sophie's head would be. She drew the conclusion that Sophie had placed her forehead against the door.

""But, I was miserable anyway. I still suffered. Because I knew you were out there somewhere, I couldn't bring myself to care for Kate the way I should have been caring for you.""

Ryan's lip quivered. This time she did get closer to the door. Ryan rested her own forehead on it before sliding down and sitting with her back up against it. Her knees pressed into her chest.

""I got complacent. After a while, I just assumed you were better off without me.""

""I wasn't."" Ryan insisted.

""I wish I would have realized that sooner."" Sophie's voice is right next to Ryan's ear. She must be sitting in the hallway of Ryan's apartment building with her back against the door. Their positions mirrored.

""Me too."" Ryan whispered to herself.

""I am so fucking sorry, Ryan.""

Another soft thud, ""Do I scare you, Ryan? Because you terrify me.""

Ryan stood up quickly. She opened the door with a determination she hadn't felt in years.

Sophie fell backwards into the apartment with a yelp. Her head resting at Ryan's slipper-clad feet. She smiled up with her a goofy grin.

""I thought I was going to eventually have to kick this door open or something.""

""Stand up."" Ryan said simply.

""God, you're bossy."" Sophie said but she didn't move. Uncaring that several people had to step over her legs to get to their apartments.

""You'll get used to it. Now, stand up.""

Sophie finally did as told. She leaned against the doorway waiting for the next order she just naturally knew Ryan was going to give her.

""You're sorry and you admit that making me wait for you was stupid and mean?""

""Yes to all of the above.""

Ryan nodded slowly, ""Okay. Then, ask me out.""

Sophie smirked annoying smirk that Ryan couldn't wait to wipe off her face. Preferably, with own face.

But I missed you more than I thought I would

"Put Your Name On It","Kelly Rowland","","","","Kelly Rowland","Just a Little Bit of Your Heart: Deleted Scenes","""Let's dance,"" Sophie said as she pushed off of her stool and led Ryan towards the dance floor, hands still on her hips. Sophie walked them over to the DJ and she leaned in, giving a song request. The DJ nodded once before Sophie led Ryan again towards the dance floor. The opening melody of Kelly Rowland's Put Your Name On It played as Sophie stood behind Ryan and began dancing, hands still on her hips. Ryan began moving with her and they found themselves getting lost in the lyrics. 

And I can't even help you, babe

And I don't want you to ever stop

Stop the way that your loving me

Baby, you've got my heart

With everything that's inside of me

Give you more than just part of me

You know that you got my heart

The song choice was deliberate, for the streets and for Ryan. Sophie had been the talk of The Hold Up for long enough and the women there needed to find another topic of conversation. She belonged to Ryan. The ring on her finger, a symbol of their tether and the ultimate representation of their partnership, should've been enough to let them hoes know as Jordan would say, but as it was, she hoped their appearance together and Ryan's interaction with Cassie was enough to deter anyone else. 

Only for you

Baby, it's all yours

You can put your name on it

Only for you

What you waiting for?

You can put your name on it

Only for you

Baby, it's all yours

You can put your name on it

Only for you

Baby, you got my heart

Ryan turned towards Sophie and wrapped her arms around her neck. Sophie pulled her in close and together they rocked to the music. She was so close to Sophie that she could feel the heat radiating from her. She turned around again and Sophie held her by the waist. Ryan made eye contact with Deja and Cassie who just so happened to be dancing together. She ground her ass into Sophie's pelvis and flashed her ring as a reminder to them both of who retired Sophie's roster. 

Petty Ryan would always make a resurgence when it came to Sophie Wilder-Moore. 

Sophie caught the gesture and laughed lowly before licking the outer edge of Ryan's ear, eliciting a shiver from her wife. 

""As much as I enjoy the show we're giving them, I'd much rather star in our own,"" Sophie said as she bent down to kiss the side of Ryan's neck.

"Before I Let Go","Maze","Frankie Beverly","","","Maze, Frankie Beverly","Batwoman AU (part 2)","The sounds of Maze featuring Frankie Beverly in concert fill the air. Ryan has begun a 2-step in Sophie’s main hallway. Sophie steps off key over to her blinds and opens them before joining Ryan in her 2-step. Both turn to face each other. 

Ryan is feeling good and allowing the music to flow through her. The stress of earlier is completely gone. She belts out the first verse. “You made me happy. This you can bet. You stood right beside me, yeah. And I won’t forget. I really love you. You should know. I wanna make sure I’m right, girl. Before I let go.” 

Sophie picks up the next verse as Ryan catches her breath and continues to dance with a full grin showing all her teeth. “Now we’ve had our good time. That’s not the same. We’re hurtin’ each other. Girl it’s a shame. I won’t be foolish, no, no. I’ve got to know. I wanna make sure I’m right, girl, oh. Before I let go.” 

Both women look up and continue singing the song together. “You know I thank God sun rises and shines on you. You know there’s nothin’, nothin’, nothin’, I would not do. Whoa, no.” 

As the guitar solo begins Sophie runs into her guest bathroom and grabs a comb and brush. She hands the brush to Ryan, who accepts her fake mic graciously. 

Ryan sings alone. “We were so close. I love you’re strong, ooh. I can’t understand it, no no. Where did we go wrong? I won’t be askin’, girl. I want to know. I wanna make sure I’m right, girl. Before I let go, ah-ha, ah-ha.” Sophie can hear Ryan accentuating the performance repeating the adverbs. It’s cute. 

As the song came to a close Ryan picked up her phone and paused the song. “I should’ve known you’d be into the old skool jams.” ","<p>The sounds of <strong>Maze featuring Frankie Beverly</strong> in concert fill the air.

<p>As the guitar solo begins Sophie runs into her guest bathroom and grabs a comb and brush. She hands the brush to Ryan, who accepts her fake mic graciously.&nbsp;</p>

As “RUMPSHAKER” began Sophie quipped, “Okay, Ms. Wilder.” Ryan ignored Sophie as she shook her rump exaggeratedly. Seeing this Sophie just joined along shaking her bottom and waving her hands above her head or at her sides. Neither of them sang along.

The song comes to a close and Ryan answers Sophie’s unasked question. “I heard this song during a block party when I was 10 and all I knew was ‘All I wanna do is zoom-a-zoom-zoom-zoom in a boom-boom.” 

With her eyes glowing Sophie laughed, “It’s not ‘in a boom-boom’, it’s “and a poom-poom’. But when I saw girls my age dancing to this I knew too.” 

“How old were you when the song came out?” Ryan asked. 

Sophie looked thoughtful as she scrunched her nose, “Probably 5 or about to turn 5. Not in school, why?” 

Ryan sat down, “I was born the year this song came out.” Fear washed over her like a cold shower. Her eyes dimmed again and there was an overwhelming feeling of doubt. What was she doing? There was no way she could be good enough for an Army vet. Sophie was a soldier and she deserved a fighter. ","<p>Sophie retrieved Ryan&rsquo;s phone and started the next song.

Sophie pulled out her best soul train hip sway. It was all long legs and her snapping fingers. Ryan looked up at Sophie and Sophie made both hands into peace signs and drug them past her eyes. Ryan tried to hold it in, but with Sophie staring at her with her shiny eyes Ryan fell back on the couch and laughed. Sophie gradually pulled Ryan back up and bumped her with her hip. Ryan fell out again. She saw how serious Sophie was as she continued swaying from left to right. Ryan stifled her laughing and joined Sophie for a few hip bumps. 

It was insane how dancing to oldies could make Ryan feel like she was flying. The last time she danced to these kinds of songs was with Mama Cora in their apartment. Mama Cora had cassette tapes and once Ryan connected with her mama over the music she rewound those tapes back and forth. If she could stay with Mama Cora in that apartment all day, no matter what they were doing the tapes played. Mama Cora would braid her hair to this music, cook dinner, clean the apartment. Ryan also remembered greasing Mama Cora’s scalp, shucking ears of corn, snapping green beans, anything you could think of to these songs. 

As the song stopped Ryan clutched Sophie to her. “Can you just hold me for a second?” Ryan whispered. 

Sophie replied, “Sure.” She rubbed Ryan’s back and just held her. She could feel Ryan’s heart beating fast. Ryan felt Sophie’s steady heartbeat. Sophie had such strong arms, while her hands were gentle. Ryan trembled a little in the embrace. 

“Thank you for this,” Ryan whispered. “This is nice.”

 Ryan looked down, about the surroundings of her environment, and then the camera. “ It used to feel fleeting. ” Head cocked, she chewed a lip and seemed to think before expounding, “ Now it’s overwhelming?” 

“ Overwhelming ?” they probed. 

“ I learned to not look for it, because so much of it has been stolen in my lifetime. I drew in and chose to be almost detached .” 

“ Someone changed that for you? ” 

 Her expression softened, became younger. A light smile played around her mouth. “ Someones ,” she stressed. “ but for the sake of transparency, I will tell Gotham, Twitter, and most of the horny gays on Tumblr that I do, in fact, have a woman who plays in my hair and tells me I’m pretty over oatmeal açaí berry bowls in the morning .” She sighed audibly. “ I wasn’t being my authentic self when I said otherwise .” Staring directly into the lens, she explained, “ I was afraid. As mentioned, there’s safety in solitude .” Her shoulders jerked. “ But unless I can believe the life I have is deserved, that good things are for me, I can’t know joy. ” Ryan grew solemn. “ She brings me joy. An insane amount. ” Her mouth trembled slightly. “ So baby, if you’re hearing this at all—and I’ll have them run it as many times as they need to—fear doesn’t get to determine the extent of which I live life publicly anymore.“ 

 It darkened as ecstatic whistles and calls rent the air. Following, a slow velvety melody of Evergreen began, showing various video clips and photos from LGBTQ+ couples of all orientations and ethnicities. Just before it stopped, a minute clip of Ryan cut back in, dressed for laser tag game night. It was obviously selfie footage from the way she held a moving camera before her and spun to show the background where an unaware Sophie sat with Luke and Mary drinking slushies post-game. 

 “ Dear diary ,” she hummed with a wide smile. “ I think that lady might be the most unhinged laser tagger I’ve ever seen. She literally yelled, ‘die, die, die,’  while shooting. I’m concerned.” 

 Laughter startled out of her and others as her face went hot in surprised delight. 

“ But she real cute tho’. And I like her or whatever.” 

The screen went black and the Sophie couldn’t hear past the ringing in her ears, feel past the elated numbness in her toes. 

“I want to encourage everyone here,” Ryan was saying on stage, “to remember that their perspective of a life in lonely, hopeless solitude because of who you find consenting passion with is not a truth with any foundation.","<p><em>&ldquo; What does love feel like to you?&rdquo;</em> a masculine voice questioned from the background.</p>

They danced to Make Me Feel by Janelle Monae for the final routine. The song had a lot of versatility and could easily be used to fuse various dance styles. She had made the routine a narrative, with Ryan in a version of her Bat Team costume and Sophie in a sexy villain outfit. The dance told the story of a villain trying to carry out a heist of the mirrorball trophy by seducing the hero to sneak by. The hero suspected it was a trick, and they fought until they realized they were actually in love with the villain. The big ending was the in-love couple committing the heist together. Sophie knew it was a little camp, but so were both the Bat Team show and Dancing with the Stars, to be honest. So it would work.","<p>Chapter Title: <strong>Week 10: Make Me Feel</strong></p>

<p>The opening part of the song was slow and bass-heavy, perfect for a rumba that told the seduction part of the story. Sophie loved the exaggeration she could put in, including all the sexiest dips and grinds in her arsenal to lay on the villain persona. Ryan was acting so well, and Sophie loved watching how expressive she was. It really helped sell this whole narrative-style dance.&nbsp;</p>","jump_the_gunn","","jump_the_gunn",10,"Make Me Feel by Janelle Monáe","and everyday I’m learning about you (the things that no one else sees) by jump_the_gunn","<div><strong>Make Me Feel by Janelle Monáe</strong></div><div>and everyday I’m learning about you (the things that no one else sees) by jump_the_gunn</div>",2022-12-01,"5gW5dSy3vXJxgzma4rQuzH","5gW5dSy3vXJxgzma4rQuzH?utm_source=generator",0,"https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d0000b2730a60fb0deda858270cca82ee",0.859,0.413,1,-7.399,1,0.182,0.132,"Dancing, Dancing Competion","https://archiveofourown.org/works/36229327/chapters/108973434#workskin","2018-04-27","<a href=""https://archiveofourown.org/works/36229327/chapters/108973434#workskin"" target=""_blank""

"Let Me Clear My Throat","DJ Kool","","","","DJ Kool","Batwoman AU (part 6)","Mary and Jordan both shrugged and Jordan replied, “Blame Soph. She basically threatened us.” Both climbed in followed by Ryan. She sat in the seat she’d taken on the trip to talk to Precious. Mary and Jordan opted for the third row seats. 

“Where are we off to first, ladies?” Amy looked into the rearview mirror. 

“We’re going to Gotham Mall, Amy,” Mary replied. 

Jordan leaned forward and smiled, “Please start the special playlist.”

Ryan looked out the window and didn’t realize until 3 songs in that the special playlist was just the songs Ryan had shared with Sophie. She looked back at Jordan. “So, Sophie told you about my playlist.” 

Jordan shook her head, “She only told me to ask to start it after you got in.” 

Ryan nodded her head to DJ Kool as “Let Me Clear My Throat” played. She’d be bringing this up to Sophie later tonight. As the truck cruised Ryan began wondering what Sophie’s angle was. They were obviously going to be doing some shopping, but that couldn’t be all. ","<p>Mary and Jordan both shrugged and Jordan replied, &ldquo;Blame Soph.

As Amy pulled the SUV up outside, Jordan handed Ryan a key. Ryan tried to hand it back. Jordan held up her key ring. “That’s not mine.” Ryan took a deep breath and grabbed her shopping bags. There were quite a few more than she expected. As Ryan waddled to the front door Jordan saw her mother’s car pull up.  




Ryan opened the door to the condo and as she slowly stepped inside she heard Kool and The Gang’s “Celebration” playing. She pushed the door closed as her eyes took in the dimmed lighting. The light from the living room was soft and she smelled some take-out. 

As she rounded the corner to the living room, Ryan saw Sophie was seated on the couch in her usual white button-up and black slacks.

Then there was a knock at the door. Sophie exhaled and said “Wait right here.” She picked up her phone and walked to the door. Snatching the door open, Sophie glared at Diane. “Hi, Mom.”      




“Hey sweetie, a friend from the church said they saw you earlier with the CEO from Wayne . Why didn’t you tell me you got the job?” Diane asked with a puzzled look. She was dressed in a cream-colored dress Sophie had seen a thousand times. 




Sophie took a deep breath turning her speakers all the way up before starting “Easy” by the Commodores, “Do you remember this song, Mom?” Diane nodded. “I didn’t tell you because,” Sophie began singing, “Know it sounds funny. But I just can’t stand the pain. Girl, I’m leaving you tomorrow. Seems to me, girl. You know I’ve done all I can. You see I begged, stole, and I borrowed, yeah, ooh.” 




“Sophie, will you just talk to me?” Diane cried out. 

Ryan had been hovering at the corner of the living room listening. Sophie saw her and extended her hand to Ryan. “Mom, I was done with you when you called Ryan a heathen and walked out of my hospital room. Now.” Sophie started the song again ‘That’s why I’m easy. I’m easy like Sunday morning. That’s why I’m easy. Easy like Sunday morning.’ Sophie paused the song as Diane looked as if she was about to speak. “Mom, save it because there’s nothing you can say that will change anything. Tonight I’m going to ask Ryan to be my girlfriend and you’re interrupting that.” With a flick of her wrist the door slammed in Diane’s face. ","<p>&ldquo;Our lives are so crazy right now and I just want you to know--&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

Ryan accepted the hand Sophie held out and allowed her to lead them to the dance floor, away from the crowd. Luther Vandross' Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas was the soundtrack to their first dance and as Ryan swayed to the music with her arms around Sophie's neck and Sophie's hands wrapped around her waist, Ryan couldn't help but praise her mama's Christmas miracles.

""You're worth the risk.""

Ryan took the mistletoe from Sophie and held it up above their heads with one hand and took Sophie's chin with the other, bringing their lips together.

"Baby, It's Cold Outside","Frank Sinatra","Dorothy Kirsten","","","Frank Sinatra, Dorothy Kirsten","Home for the Holidays","Ryan changed the subject and pulled out a few ornaments from the box. There was a brown felt gingerbread man and brown felt reindeer with glitter on it and some paper snowflakes. Ryan got up and put them on the tree. I think Mary has a box of Christmas ornaments too in the cabinet. Sophie went to find the ornaments. When Sophie came back with the box of Mary’s ornaments she set it down. Then she pulled her phone out and started up the Christmas music once more as it had been paused.

I really can’t stay…

R: Baby it’s cold outside…

S: I’ve got to go ‘way…

R: Baby it’s cold outside…

S: The evening has been

R: Hoping that you’d drop in…

S: So very nice…

R: I’ll hold your hands, they’re just like ice…

Ryan and Sophie snag along to the music as they continued decorating the tree and looking through Ryan’s memories of her Mama Cora.

S: My mother will start to worry…

R: Beautiful what’s your hurry…

S: My father will be pacing the floor…

R: Listen to that fire place roar…

S: So really I’d better scurry…

R: Beautiful please don’t hurry…

S: Well maybe just a half a drink more…

R: Put some music on while I pour…

Ryan and Sophie had stopped putting decorations on the trees and looking at photos and now they were singing right to each other, seemingly suspended in time and space.

S: The neighbors might think…

R: Baby it’s bad out there…

S: Say, what’s in this drink…

R: No cabs to be had out there…

S: I wish I knew how…

R: Your eyes are like starlight now…

S: To break this spell…

R: I’ll take your hat, your hair looks swell…

Ryan smiled because Sophie’s hair did look swell, and her eyes did look like starlight and she felt for a moment like they weren’t singing along to some silly Christmas song, but that maybe this was all too real.

S: Hey, you missed your part.

Sophie joked.

R: Did you ever realize how this song is kinda giving Law and Order Special Victims Unit? She said it’s cold bruh. She tryna leave.

S: Oh my gosh Ryan, way to ruin the moment. And this song.

Sophie shook her head. Whatever spell that was brewing between them was broken.

R: Soph I’m serious! “Say, what’s in this drink?” What the hell does that mean? And he clearly can’t take no for an answer.

Ryan was indignant about getting Sophie to see how bad this song was.

S: Now you sound like Jordan. You don’t think the lady in the song was playing hard to get? It seemed like she wanted to stay, she just wanted him to beg her to stay. I’m not gonna let you ruin that song for me.

Sophie tossed some tinsel at Ryan.

R: Hey! It’s not my fault that song is creepy. There are much better ones than that.

Just as the beginning notes of Beyoncé's ‘Rocket’ began to play, Ryan turned away from Sophie presenting her with another view of her spectacular ass.  She swayed back and forth in a hypnotizing cadence.  It took all of Sophie’s will power to keep from reaching out.  Then Ryan slowly lowered herself into her lap.

Show you how, I feel

Let me take this off

While you watch me… watch me’

 

The swell of Ryan’s ass fit perfectly in Sophie’s pelvis.  The throbbing between Sophie’s thighs matched the beating of her heart.  She bit her lips so hard, she was sure she’d drawn blood.   Unable to help herself, her hands instinctively moved to Ryan’s waist.  Before she could correct her mistake, Ryan turned and gave her a piercing look.  Sophie immediately removed her hands at the silent rebuke and placed them back on the arms of the chair.  Ryan winked then went back to performing, grinding into Sophie’s lap, using her body to please and tease.  Sophie shivered and moaned with each deliberate movement.  It took every bit of restraint to keep from wrapping Ryan in her arms and having her way with her then and there.","<p>Writer's Beginning Notes:</p>

Ryan thought it would be cute to drop little snippets of the song to Sophie throughout the day as a hint to her ultimate surprise.  That meant certain items had to be on the menu this morning.

Ryan took her hand and moved into Sophie’s arms.  She lay her head on her chest and they swayed to the music.  They danced and talked for hours at Maggie’s that night.  Ryan was lying back in Sophie’s arms as they watched golden rays trickle through the blinds as the sun began its accession into a new day.","<p><em>The couple had the entire diner to themselves that night.&nbsp; Maggie had set them up with their food, desserts, and anything else they would need before handing Sophie the keys for her to lock up.</em></p>

"I Hate the Way","Sofia Carson","","","","Sofia Carson","Becoming Tangled Hearts","Sophie continues to write and produce songs with the band.

"He Loves Me (Lyzel in E Flat)","Jill Scott","","","","Jill Scott","The Way You Love Me","“Miss Sophie, I would like to personally wish you a happy birthday, beautiful.  I heard it’s your favorite.  It is an honor for me to perform it for you.” 

The band began playing the intro to ‘He Loves Me’ and Sophie’s heart melted.  

Ryan took Sophie’s hand and brought it to her lips once again.  She placed a gentle kiss on her knuckles before standing.  Sophie looked up at her.

“May I have this dance?”  Ryan asked quietly. 

Without hesitation, Sophie allowed the younger woman to guide her to the dancefloor.  Ryan slipped her arms around Sophie’s waist and pulled her close.  Sophie wrapped her arms around Ryan and rested their foreheads together as the sounds of the band rose.

 

You love me especially different every time

You keep me on my feet happily excited

By your cologne, your hands, your smile, your intelligence

You woo me, you court me, you tease me, you please me

You school me, give me some things to think about

Invite me, you ignite me, you co-write me, you love me, you like me

You incite me to chorus, ooh

Ohh…

 

When the song reached the spoken word section, Sophie was surprised to hear Ryan’s voice rather than the singer’s.  The band was now playing the song very softly as Jill quietly vocalized a smooth melody in the background.

“Sophie… You’re different and special.  You’re different and special in every way imaginable.”

Sophie looked around and saw everyone’s eyes on them.  Jordan, Jada, Naomi, and several others all had their phones out recording.  They all had tears in their eyes.  She swallowed hard as the realization of what was happening started to dawn on her.  She tried to focus as Ryan continued reciting Jill’s words.

“You love me from my hair follicles to my toenails.  You got me feeling like the breeze, easy and free and lovely and me.”  Ryan paused and switched from Jill’s lyrics to her own words.  “Sophie…you make me feel like I can do anything.  Your love makes me feel like I’m ten feet tall, even though you constantly insist on reminding me how vertically challenged I am.”

A few chuckles could be heard from around the room.  Sophie smiled.  Leave it to Ryan to throw a joke in to relieve the tension.  Sophie tried to blink away the tears pooling in her eyes.

Ryan took a calming breath and held Sophie’s hands between them.  She met Sophie’s eyes with determination.  “Seriously though, all of this started when I began to think about how you love me… and how I love all the ways you love me.  Before I met you, I didn’t believe in things like true love and soul mates.  The kind of love everybody told stories about and sang about in love songs didn’t seem real to me.  Those things were for other people, not for someone like me… someone always on the move.  See, growing up in the system and being on my own, I never had the time or felt safe enough to just stop and… take a breath, to just be present.  There was always another home to move to, another job to do, or another obstacle to overcome.  Then you just… showed up in my life.  And as everyone here knows, we did not start off in a very good place.  We had to work and fight to get to where we are, and I wouldn’t trade our journey for anything.  Because for the first time in my life, I can breathe, Soph.”  Ryan’s voice cracked and Sophie reached out to catch the tear that had escaped her eye.  Ryan kissed her hand and continued.  “With you, I breathe every day. You are the love of my life, Sophie.  You are my soul mate.  You are my love song.   And I want to spend my whole damn life, my every breath loving you.”

Ryan took a deep breath and took the ring box out from behind her back. Tears already freely flowing, Sophie froze.  The music and singing lowered even more.  Sophie gasped and covered her mouth as Ryan dropped to one knee.  There wasn’t a dry eye in the room at this point.

Ryan opened the ring box and looked up at Sophie.  “Sophia Rose Moore… will do me the honor of spending forever with me?  Will you marry me?”

Too emotional to speak, Sophie just nodded her head up and down before pulling Ryan to her feet into a deep kiss.  The sounds of whistling and clapping could be heard in the background as the music rose and Jill’s voice resumed the song.  Sophie cradled Ryan’s face in her hand as she placed kiss after kiss to her lips. Ryan, in tears herself by now, let out a relieved laugh. ","<p>&ldquo;Miss Sophie, I would like to personally wish you a happy birthday, beautiful.&nbsp; I heard it&rsquo;s your favorite.&nbsp; It is an honor for me to perform it for you.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

“ Alexa , play HER “ Every Kind Of Way” and turn down the lights.” Ryan pulled the index card from her pocket.

Baby, the sound of you
Better than a harmony
I want you off my mind
And on me

“Hey babe. ” Sophie walks off the elevator and closes the bookshelf. “ Why is it dark here ? “ She looks around Ryan’s office .

Holding me closer than we've ever been before
This ain't a dream
You're here with me
Boy, it don't get no better than you
For you, I wanna take my time
All night

“ I want to ask you a question but first you have to do something for me .” Ryan holds out 2 cards . “ Pick One.” she smiles shyly at Sophie.

I wanna love you in every kind of way
I wanna please you, no matter how long it takes

“ Okay .” a confused but amused smile appears on Sophie’s face as she grabs one of the cards.

If the world should end tomorrow and we only have today
I'm gonna love you in every kind of way

“ Flowers.” She reads the card out loud. “ Read the back “. Ryan gives her a soft smile.

Give you all, give you all of me
When you need it

“ You bring out the romantic in me but I want to give you more than flowers.” Ryan holds out 2 more cards.

Cause I need it
I wanna fall like your favorite season
I'll never get up

“ Dressy. '' Sophie turns the card around. “ Let’s dress to impress and show them who Wildmoore is.” Sophie smirks at Ryan and picks another card from the next set.

Stay here forever, babe
It don't get no better than this
Your kiss

“ You drive.” Sophie laughs and turns the card around . “ I always drive unless this means I get to drive the Batmobile.” Omg I’m sure the people of Gotham would love to see the Commissioner driving the Batmobile.” Ryan laughs . Sophie reads the back of the card “ You take the wheel while I captivate your heart.” Okay I guess I can drive this time too.” Ryan just holds out the next 2 cards.

I wanna love you in every kind of way
I wanna please you, no matter how long it takes
If the world should end tomorrow and we only have today

“ Picnic.” Sophie turns the card around . “ I’ll play you in a game of one on one for what ? Your heart.” Sophie puts her hand on her chest. “You already have it, love but I’ll still kick your ass on the court.” she smirks at Ryan who laughs “ Don’t write a check your ass can’t cash and don’t let my height fool you.” Sophie laughs “ You mean lack thereof .” “ Awww babe you know Love and Basketball is my guilty pleasure. This is so sweet.” “Well finish picking so I can ask my question ?” Ryan holds out 2 more cards.

I'm gonna love you in every kind of way
I wanna love you in every kind of way
I wanna please you, no matter how long it takes

“Painting? Sophie questions but Ryan just points to the back of the card. “Life is a canvas and I want to finish painting mine with you.”

“ You are it for me Soph , You are what I want and need.” Ryan has a huge grin on her face as she wipes the tear that has escaped off of Sophie’s cheek. “ Don’t get soft on me now, Crowphie, you have more cards to pick.” She holds out 2 more cards.

If the world should end tomorrow and we only have today
I'm gonna love you in every kind of way

“Dinner.” She turns the card around . “ I want to feed your soul and nourish your heart.” Ryan holds out 2 more cards. “ Watch the stars. “ she turns the card around. “ To me you are the stars. You outshine all of the darkness that tries to cloud my days.” Ryan holds out 2 more cards.

I wanna love you
I gotta love you
I wanna love you
I gotta love you

“Good morning kiss.” Before Sophie turns the card around she grabs Ryan’s hand and pulls her into her. Ryan wraps her arms around Sophie’s waist. Sophie grabs Ryan’s face with her free hand and kisses her deeply. “ I have been wanting to do that for a while.” Sophie pulls back and looks into Ryan’s chocolate brown eyes. “ Read the back baby.” Ryan stares back into Sophie’s honey ones. Sophie removes her hand and turns the card around. “ Kiss me when you finally wake up from being left breathless and satisfied.” Ryan takes the cards from Sophie and puts them down on her desk. She grabs Sophie and turns her around revealing the sign and the tealights. While still holding Sophie in her arms Ryan whispers in her ear . “ Will you be my Valentine ?” Sophie turns around in Ryan’s arms and kisses her again. She nibbles at her bottom lip to ask for more and Ryan abides allowing Sophie to explore her mouth with her tongue. They both pull away from the air. “ Yes .” Sophie takes a breath. They both have huge smiles on their faces.

“Well you just planned our Valentine's Day date babe .” Ryan kisses Sophie again.","<p>Story or Chapter Title: <strong>Every Kind Of Way</strong></p>

<p>&ldquo; Dressy. '' Sophie turns the card around. &ldquo; Let&rsquo;s dress to impress and show them who Wildmoore is.&rdquo; Sophie smirks at Ryan and picks another card from the next set.</p>
<p><strong><em>Stay here forever, babe</em></strong><br /><strong><em>It don't get no better than this</em></strong><br /><strong><em>Your kiss</em></strong></p>
<p>&ldquo; You drive.&rdquo; Sophie laughs and turns the card around . &ldquo; I always drive unless this means I get to drive the Batmobile.&rdquo; Omg I&rsquo;m sure the people of Gotham would love to see the Commissioner driving the Batmobile.&rdquo; Ryan laughs . Sophie reads the back of the card &ldquo; You take the wheel while I captivate your heart.&rdquo; Okay I guess I can drive this time too.&rdquo; Ryan just holds out the next 2 cards.</p>
<p><strong><em>I wanna love you in every kind of way</em></strong><br /><strong><em>I wanna please you, no matter how long it takes</em></strong><br /><strong><em>If the world should end tomorrow and we only have today</em></strong></p>
<p>&ldquo; Picnic.&rdquo; Sophie turns the card around . &ldquo; I&rsquo;ll play you in a game of one on one for what ? Your heart.&rdquo; Sophie puts her hand on her chest. &ldquo;You already have it, love but I&rsquo;ll still kick your ass on the court.&rdquo; she smirks at Ryan who laughs &ldquo; Don&rsquo;t write a check your ass can&rsquo;t cash and don&rsquo;t let my height fool you.&rdquo; Sophie laughs &ldquo; You mean lack thereof .&rdquo; &ldquo; Awww babe you know Love and Basketball is my guilty pleasure. This is so sweet.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well finish picking so I can ask my question ?&rdquo; Ryan holds out 2 more cards.</p>
<p><strong><em>I'm gonna love you in every kind of way</em></strong><br /><strong><em>I wanna love you in every kind of way</em></strong><br /><strong><em>I wanna please you, no matter how long it takes</em></strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;Painting? Sophie questions but Ryan just points to the back of the card. &ldquo;Life is a canvas and I want to finish painting mine with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo; You are it for me Soph , You are what I want and need.&rdquo; Ryan has a huge grin on her face as she wipes the tear that has escaped off of Sophie&rsquo;s cheek. &ldquo; Don&rsquo;t get soft on me now, Crowphie, you have more cards to pick.&rdquo; She holds out 2 more cards.</p>
<p><strong><em>If the world should end tomorrow and we only have today</em></strong><br /><strong><em>I'm gonna love you in every kind of way</em></strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;Dinner.&rdquo; She turns the card around . &ldquo; I want to feed your soul and nourish your heart.&rdquo; Ryan holds out 2 more cards. &ldquo; Watch the stars. &ldquo; she turns the card around. &ldquo; To me you are the stars. You outshine all of the darkness that tries to cloud my days.&rdquo; Ryan holds out 2 more cards.</p>
<p><strong><em>I wanna love you</em></strong><br /><strong><em>I gotta love you</em></strong><br /><strong><em>I wanna love you</em></strong><br /><strong><em>I gotta love you</em></strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning kiss.&rdquo; Before Sophie turns the card around she grabs Ryan&rsquo;s hand and pulls her into her. Ryan wraps her arms around Sophie&rsquo;s waist. Sophie grabs Ryan&rsquo;s face with her free hand and kisses her deeply. &ldquo; I have been wanting to do that for a while.&rdquo; Sophie pulls back and looks into Ryan&rsquo;s chocolate brown eyes. &ldquo; Read the back baby.&rdquo; Ryan stares back into Sophie&rsquo;s honey ones. Sophie removes her hand and turns the card around. &ldquo; Kiss me when you finally wake up from being left breathless and satisfied.&rdquo; Ryan takes the cards from Sophie and puts them down on her desk. She grabs Sophie and turns her around revealing the sign and the tealights. While still holding Sophie in her arms Ryan whispers in her ear . &ldquo; Will you be my Valentine ?&rdquo; Sophie turns around in Ryan&rsquo;s arms and kisses her again. She nibbles at her bottom lip to ask for more and Ryan abides allowing Sophie to explore her mouth with her tongue. They both pull away from the air. &ldquo; Yes .&rdquo; Sophie takes a breath. They both have huge smiles on their faces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well you just planned our Valentine's Day date babe .&rdquo; Ryan kisses Sophie again.</p>","rebelteacher94","","rebelteacher94",1,"Every Kind of Way by H.E.R.","Every Kind Of Way by rebelteacher94","<div><strong>Every Kind of Way by H.E.R.</strong></div><div>Every Kind Of Way by rebelteacher94</div>",2023-01-30,"0Aa3g9EQoPNt6PiKjaUeb7","0Aa3g9EQoPNt6PiKjaUeb7?utm_source=generator",0,"https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d0000b273b5d9c8de465654c20d77305c",0.416,0.298,7,-8.499,1,0.0442,0.635,"Played, Story or Chapter Title, inspriation","https://archiveofourown.org/works/44646025/chapters/112318762","2017-10-20","<a href=""https://archiveofourown.org/works/44646025/chapters/112318762"" target=""_blank""

"Comfortable","H.E.R.","","","","H.E.R.","A Gift (or 14) of Me to You","The twelfth gift was an honest to God burned CD that Sophie had to pull out an old laptop and wait an hour for it to fully charge in order to listen to. 

The note accompanying it was the album cover which read, You're my favorite song .

Sophie sat back on her couch and listened to the opening notes of H.E.R.'s Comfortable . The next song, Everything by Mary J. Blige took her back to her youth and how she hoped to have that special someone like Mary sang about. Song three, More of You by Victoria Monet, solidified for her that Ryan was her secret admirer. It was their song. During one of their dates, Ryan played the song and they danced together in the loft after Ryan cooked dinner for them. They made love well into the night and Sophie felt Ryan's flame dance over her. It was the night she realized she was falling in love with Ryan Wilder and she was powerless to stop it.  

The next songs, Two Occasions by Babyface, You're Always on my Mind by SWV, and You Bring Me Joy by Anita Baker, all told the story of how Ryan felt about Sophie but it was Ready or Not by After 7 that gave her pause. Did Ryan really love her? Sophie hoped she did, but it seemed with each passing day, prior to the start of her receiving gifts and thinking that it could possibly be Ryan, that Ryan didn't feel the same. But according to the song choice, she loved Sophie, too. 

Smile by V. Bozeman, Real Thing by Pink Sweat$ ft. Tori Kelly, Excuse Me by Jazmine Sullivan, and Can't Take My Eyes Off of You by Lauryn Hill followed. The final song, Soon As I Get Home by Faith Evans, took her by surprise. Unlike the previous songs, Soon As I Get Home was an apology, a promise that Ryan would make up for her previous behavior and would make things right between them, given the chance. Ryan didn't want to lose her and wanted to make it up to her and Sophie wanted nothing more. 

Part of her wanted to go to the loft and talk to Ryan right then but a greater part of her needed to know how things would naturally play out. She'd done her part and asked Ryan for what she wanted. It was time for Ryan to do the same. ","<p>The twelfth gift was an honest to God burned CD that Sophie had to pull out an old laptop and wait an hour for it to fully charge in order to listen to.&nbsp;</p>

"Everything","Mary J. Blige","","","","Mary J. Blige","A Gift (or 14) of Me to You","The twelfth gift was an honest to God burned CD that Sophie had to pull out an old laptop and wait an hour for it to fully charge in order to listen to. 

The note accompanying it was the album cover which read, You're my favorite song .

Sophie sat back on her couch and listened to the opening notes of H.E.R.'s Comfortable . The next song, Everything by Mary J. Blige took her back to her youth and how she hoped to have that special someone like Mary sang about. Song three, More of You by Victoria Monet, solidified for her that Ryan was her secret admirer. It was their song. During one of their dates, Ryan played the song and they danced together in the loft after Ryan cooked dinner for them. They made love well into the night and Sophie felt Ryan's flame dance over her. It was the night she realized she was falling in love with Ryan Wilder and she was powerless to stop it.  

The next songs, Two Occasions by Babyface, You're Always on my Mind by SWV, and You Bring Me Joy by Anita Baker, all told the story of how Ryan felt about Sophie but it was Ready or Not by After 7 that gave her pause. Did Ryan really love her? Sophie hoped she did, but it seemed with each passing day, prior to the start of her receiving gifts and thinking that it could possibly be Ryan, that Ryan didn't feel the same. But according to the song choice, she loved Sophie, too. 

Smile by V. Bozeman, Real Thing by Pink Sweat$ ft. Tori Kelly, Excuse Me by Jazmine Sullivan, and Can't Take My Eyes Off of You by Lauryn Hill followed. The final song, Soon As I Get Home by Faith Evans, took her by surprise. Unlike the previous songs, Soon As I Get Home was an apology, a promise that Ryan would make up for her previous behavior and would make things right between them, given the chance. Ryan didn't want to lose her and wanted to make it up to her and Sophie wanted nothing more. 

Part of her wanted to go to the loft and talk to Ryan right then but a greater part of her needed to know how things would naturally play out. She'd done her part and asked Ryan for what she wanted. It was time for Ryan to do the same. ","<p>The twelfth gift was an honest to God burned CD that Sophie had to pull out an old laptop and wait an hour for it to fully charge in order to listen to.&nbsp;</p>

"Ready Or Not","After 7","","","","After 7","A Gift (or 14) of Me to You","The twelfth gift was an honest to God burned CD that Sophie had to pull out an old laptop and wait an hour for it to fully charge in order to listen to. 

The note accompanying it was the album cover which read, You're my favorite song .

Sophie sat back on her couch and listened to the opening notes of H.E.R.'s Comfortable . The next song, Everything by Mary J. Blige took her back to her youth and how she hoped to have that special someone like Mary sang about. Song three, More of You by Victoria Monet, solidified for her that Ryan was her secret admirer. It was their song. During one of their dates, Ryan played the song and they danced together in the loft after Ryan cooked dinner for them. They made love well into the night and Sophie felt Ryan's flame dance over her. It was the night she realized she was falling in love with Ryan Wilder and she was powerless to stop it.  

The next songs, Two Occasions by Babyface, You're Always on my Mind by SWV, and You Bring Me Joy by Anita Baker, all told the story of how Ryan felt about Sophie but it was Ready or Not by After 7 that gave her pause. Did Ryan really love her? Sophie hoped she did, but it seemed with each passing day, prior to the start of her receiving gifts and thinking that it could possibly be Ryan, that Ryan didn't feel the same. But according to the song choice, she loved Sophie, too. 

Smile by V. Bozeman, Real Thing by Pink Sweat$ ft. Tori Kelly, Excuse Me by Jazmine Sullivan, and Can't Take My Eyes Off of You by Lauryn Hill followed. The final song, Soon As I Get Home by Faith Evans, took her by surprise. Unlike the previous songs, Soon As I Get Home was an apology, a promise that Ryan would make up for her previous behavior and would make things right between them, given the chance. Ryan didn't want to lose her and wanted to make it up to her and Sophie wanted nothing more. 

Part of her wanted to go to the loft and talk to Ryan right then but a greater part of her needed to know how things would naturally play out. She'd done her part and asked Ryan for what she wanted.

<p>The next songs,&nbsp;<em>Two Occasions&nbsp;</em>by Babyface,&nbsp;<em>You're Always on my Mind&nbsp;</em>by SWV, and&nbsp;<em>You Bring Me Joy&nbsp;</em>by Anita Baker, all told the story of how Ryan felt about Sophie but it was&nbsp;<em>Ready or Not&nbsp;</em>by After 7 that gave her pause. Did Ryan really love her?

I hope you enjoy, and I promise, Wildmoore is always endgame.

Song – Fall Again by Glenn Lewis

...

As they stood there, they heard the DJ. “Hey everyone, thanks for coming out tonight to support the Sheldon Park Community Center. We appreciate all of your generous donations. Now, I see a lot of couples out there, so I’m gonna slow things down just a little, and give you lovebirds something to dance to.”




The song began playing, and Ryan looked up at Sophie. “Dance with me?”




Sophie nodded. “I’d love to,” she said, pulling Ryan close.







Feels like fire burns in my heart

Every single moment that we spend apart

 

All this time away is killing me inside

I need your love in my life

 

I want to spend time till it ends

I want to fall with you again

Like we did when we first met

I want to fall with you again

 

 

Ryan laid her head against Sophie’s chest. They silently swayed back and forth, just enjoying being together. Enjoying the feeling they’d gone without for far too long.




“I’ve missed you so much, Sophie. I don’t even have the words to describe how much. Sometimes, I could hardly breathe. I was lost. I just didn’t know what…”




“I’m so sorry, Ryan. If I wasn’t so stubborn, I would have come back to you right away, but I just got so caught up in...”




“I know. So did I.”







Fought in a battle that nobody won

Now we face a mountain to be overcome

 

You can’t turn away a pass a second love

I need us to carry on

 

I want to spend time till it ends

"Under the Sea","The Little Mermaid Cast","","","","The Little Mermaid Cast","Lions Is Mermaids Too","Sophie arrives home early, deciding she’d rather spend an extra hour with her kids and then plough through her mountain of paperwork on the sofa with a glass of red than sit at her desk a moment longer. Though she’d tried to put on a positive face for the children this morning, particularly Mason who seemed quieter and in his own head more than usual on the way to school, the heavy mood Tyler had cast on them all had followed her through her day, leeching her energy and twisting a knot between her shoulders. She hasn’t heard from him, and experience tells her she probably won’t see him until the early hours when she can pretend his stumbling hasn’t woken her and just wait for him to pass out on the other side of the bed.  

She hears singing as soon as she opens the front door – a very enthusiastic rendition of Under The Sea that has both her children giggling more than joining in – and she’s grateful that the noise covers her entrance, allows her to pad quietly down the hall towards the kitchen and watch unnoticed from the doorway. Mason and Arielle sit at the small table they use unless they have guests over, finishing off what looks like spaghetti and meatballs as Ryan chops vegetables at the central island, all the while giving her best Sebastian the crab and wiggle-walking side to side.  

Ari has always been a giggler – similarly to a tantrum, it really doesn’t take much to make her laugh – but Mason is a tougher audience, usually stopping at a smile or amused huff. But as Ryan lifts two spoons in her left hand and starts clapping them like maracas and dancing across the kitchen, Mason laughs so hard he spits spaghetti sauce onto the table, and Sophie feels like she’s about to cry for the second time today. The events of the morning do not seem to have tainted her children’s day – in fact, they appear untouched, unaffected. Protected somehow.  

Sophie finds the how when their new Nanny spins to an abrupt stop, eyes meeting hers, a slightly embarrassed smile curling up one side of her mouth.

Ryan gasped loudly. “Ryan Wilder, I knew then what I absolutely know now,” the tears couldn’t be held back any longer as Ryan looked at the oil painting of the moment they celebrated officially becoming a thing. Ryan and Sophie went to The Hold Up. After a few drinks and a lot of dancing, Sophie stepped away to the sound booth and whispered, “does the DJ take requests?” The moment the song played was unexpectedly captured and posted on The Hold Up’s Instagram page. It was Ryan leaning into Sophie’s chest, her eyes closed, her smile peaceful, Sophie kissing the crown of her head as Somi’s Ginger Me Slowly stitched their beginning together. The canvas painted was draped with replicas of Poison Ivy's vines and pepper lights. It was propped up by a stand that was modeled in the fashion of the cabin: the backdrop of their first kiss. The realisation of the synergy of all these moments led to a small chuckle, “so you like it?”

“Sophie Moore is that even a question? You can ask me but you already know my answer,” Sophie took that as the moment to queue Judah into action. As she turned to look at him, he sensed something and went running at the fence.

She called out to him, “Judah, back boy, back!” He ran to the furthest end of the fence and was ferociously growling and digging. Sophie and Ryan ran over to see what was wrong as Judah let out a whimper it happened. The family of three was collectively skunked. Sophie was deflated. 

“Judah, you had one job,” Ryan looked at Judah’s collar. His name tag had been replaced with a ring. Sitting there smelling like rotting onions and burned plastic Ryan chuckled as she reached across to wipe the tear from her lover’s despondent face.

“Given our history, this is smelly perfection.”

“Is it?” Sophie huffed.

“You plotted each moment to the minute. The to-do lists that keep you grounded. I love your to-do list and the way life always reminds you that moments can’t be planned. I love your instant disappointment when things shift just a millimeter left of your plan. You told me the story of us. So, I hate to break it to your stinky face, but you do have the words. So, can you ask me now because I am really looking forward to my part?” Judah started rubbing his face on Sophie’s jogger pants. 




The woman hung her head, covering her face with her palm. They were all sitting on the grass, the culprit was long gone. Ryan gently opened Sophie’s hands, “I’m waiting.” 




The former Crow took a conciliatory breath, “Ryan, will you–,” She cut her off.




“Yes. Every day, yes,” she took Sophie’s into hers, snarled at their stinky ringbearer, “Alexa play ginger me slowly.” Sophie collapsed into Ryan as they affirmed their smelly family of three. ","<p>Story Title:<strong> Ginger Me Slowly</strong></p>

"I Kissed A Girl","Katy Perry","","","","Katy Perry","Lions Is Mermaids Too","‘You didn’t know this was a gay bar, did you? Oh poor, stick-up-the-ass Crowphie,’ she smirked, mocking her surprise. ‘Don’t worry, the big bad lesbians won’t bother you if you don’t make eye contact. Or better still, just leave.’  

‘I...’ She’d driven there so really probably shouldn’t have, but she necked the second drink in one, hoping to buy herself some time and physical cover to conceal the flustered reaction.  

Ryan was too close to miss it though, and she kept unwavering eyes on her as she collected the empty glass.  

‘Are you -’  

‘Your girl,’ Sophie interrupted clumsily, darkening her already blushed cheeks as she rushed to clarify. ‘Angelique.’  

Ryan bristled at the mention, recrossing her arms.  

‘My fiancée,’ she corrected, her tone already carrying a warning.  

‘Has she started coming around here more? Bringing her crew?’  

‘Does the woman I’m going to marry occasionally come to my place of work – a lesbian bar – with our friends?’ Ryan scoffed, incredulous. ‘Honestly, Crowphie, whatever suppressed sexuality shit you’ve got going on, leave us out of it. Go figure your shit out somewhere else.’  

‘Angelique is using you, Ryan,’ Sophie spat back, a little too harshly. Too blatantly defensive. ‘She’s using you and this place to push her drugs and make a name for herself, and I think part of you already knows that but for whatever reason you can’t admit it. That black mark, in place of a ring, just shows how little she really values you. Your worth to her is based on what you can give, not who you are.’  

‘Real love, a real relationship, real people cannot be bought and do not need to be.’ Ryan’s voice was a razor, her blazing eyes cutting to Sophie’s left hand then back to her face as she rose up and leant heavily across the bar, right into her space. ‘You want to talk about admitting things?’ She stroked the length of Sophie’s finger with two of her own, the tip of her tongue peeking between full lips and slowly curling back in. ‘How wet are you right now?’  

She didn’t wait for a response. Walked out from behind the bar and across the small dancefloor to the DJ booth near the frosted bay windows. Sophie’s body turned on her stool like it was on a pully, attached and without choice. Ryan continued to watch her as she spoke into the DJ’s ear. Smirking as the track began to change and the blue-haired woman at the controls unmuted her mic.  

‘This guilty pleasure is for those still harbouring their own. Don’t worry, this is a safe space. We’ve all kissed a girl and liked it.’  

Sophie was out the door before the first line was sung.  ","<p>&lsquo;You didn&rsquo;t know this was a gay bar, did you?

"Kiss the Girl","The Little Mermaid Cast","","","","The Little Mermaid Cast","Lions Is Mermaids Too","The whole fucking world stops turning, and Sophie is at its centre, all eyes on her for an explanation.  

‘Of course not,’ Diane Moore scoffs, trying to lighten it with an empty laugh. ‘Ladies don’t kiss ladies, sweetheart.’  

Ryan and Jordan have honed in on the conversation, completely still just a few feet away. Mason has moved to take his aunt’s hand; the other kids looking around confused.  

‘That’s not true, Mom,’ Sophie says, as levelly as her quivering throat will allow, keeping her eyes on her daughter. ‘People can love and kiss whoever they want when they grow up.’ She looks to Hallie with a reassuring smile. ‘And if they don’t want to kiss people that’s absolutely fine too. Everyone should do what makes their heart happy.’ Her eyes wander instinctively over the small girl to Ryan, holding there, holding them all in a dawning silence.  

‘Is your heart happy, Mommy?’ Ari asks with a yawn.  

‘It’s trying to be, baby.’  

Without a word, Tyler stands up and walks out of the room. And because the universe is a sadistic little shit, the only sound left is that of The Little Mermaid soundtrack.

"Count On Me","Whitney Houston","CeCe Winans","","","Whitney Houston, CeCe Winans","The In-between","Jordan lowers herself onto the couch in her office, relieved that she opted for something soft and cosy. As she sinks deeper into the couch, she feels a little weight being lifted off her shoulders, just a little. Sophie’s warmth was always her safe space, she's been managing on hard days but today is weighing heavier than any other hard day she's had and she wishes she could feel the warmth of her sisters embrace again. 




She feels the sting of her tears threatening to fall. The sudden warmth she feels encircling her uncovers the deep cracks in the dam she's built to keep herself going. The dam breaks and she sobs into her palms, the more she cried the more the warmth engulfed her, a cycle. 




Jordan’s voice breaks as she speaks through her tears, “Soph I miss you so much” 




“I miss you too baby sis” 




Jordans not sure if her heart breaks or swells at the sound of her sister’s voice. A bit of both? Her sobs grow louder. “I wish I could just hug you foreal” 




“Im right here Jord”,  she hugs Jordan a little tighter. Her sister crumbles a little more in her embrace




“Call on me I will be there”




Jordan hears Sophie’s voice. Their song. When Jordan was younger it was the only thing that would calm her, that song and her sister singing it, nobody else. As she got older the song took on its own meaning, it was a promise, a pact between them both. Wherever they were, whatever they were doing, they’d always be there for each other. It was a call and response. It was her turn 




Jordan sings through her sobs,  “don't be afraid”




“Please believe me when I say”




Jordan: Count on me




Jordan feels a familiar squeeze to her hand, it does nothing to calm her. Only spurs her tears even more. Sophie sits with her for a little while, knowing her sister can feel her presence, even if she can’t physically be there. This will have to be enough for now. ","<p>Jordan lowers herself onto the couch in her office, relieved that she opted for something soft and cosy.

...

AirPods shoved into her ears. Nikes laced and ready to pound the pavement. Replaying the events of a dream. She didn’t dream often. Or if she did she didn’t usually remember. 




On the rare occasion she did remember, she’d head straight to Google for an interpretation. All dreams had to have a deeper meaning right? Her subconscious layering metaphors about hidden or unknown feelings deep within her that she had yet to discover. 




This one however was vivid, so detailed it was blurring her ability to separate it from reality. And she didn’t need google to interpret its meaning. What she did need was to clear it from her mind. Erase it from existence. Because if she didn’t, there was zero percent chance of her being able to look Ryan in the eye without giving herself and her subconscious and now blatantly conscious desires away. 




She hit shuffle on her liked songs on Spotify and blew out a laugh as the randomly chosen song filled her ears. 




Make it stop

Sounds so good, I just can't take no more

Turn it down, turn it up, I don't know

I don't know




Of course. She wants the replaying to stop but her playlist suggests otherwise. She walked out of her condo and jogged down the stairs. As soon as her sneakers touched the pavement, she took off, turning the music up and deciding that she’d let the song play out. 




But don't stop (oh)

Don't move (oh), just keep it there (right there)

Keep it right there (ooh)

Keep it right there




She tried to focus on her breathing, her steps, the scenery passing by. But the images that were passing through her mind were preventing her body from calming. Hands and legs intertwined. Soft, intentional touches. Torturously slow exploration. Her heart rate was rising and it had nothing to do with running. 




I wanna put you on repeat

Play you everywhere I go

Everywhere I go

Play you everywhere I go




She rounded the corner into the park taking off in a full out sprint. The pace of her heartbeat and her demeanor matching the speed of jolting of consciousness at which she woke up this morning, sweating and gasping.




Don't stop (stop)

Turn it on, turn it up, make it louder (yeah)

I don't wanna miss a single thing

I wanna hear every melody (yeah)

Beating (beating, beating)

Beating so loud you can feel it (see it, see it)

Beating (beating, beating)

Beating for you




Her heartbeat was in her ears as she replayed the scene again from the beginning. Hands gripping hands and skin and hair. Lips grazing, teasing, whispering words of passion and adoration. 




Feel it all (feel it)

Feel it all crashing down (down, down, down)

I'm so lost (I'm so)

I'm so lost in (lost in) your sound (sound)




She leaned over hands on her knees as she gasped for air, willing her pulse and heartbeat to slow. 




The rest of the song faded into the background as she stood up and tilted her head up toward the sky. Hands on her hips, continuing to slow her breathing. 




“Hey Soph.” That voice. The one that she’d been hearing all morning in hushed whispers. An echo of her own mind combined with the voice she knew well. Her breath caught without even looking at her. “Fancy seeing you here.” 




Sophie found her eyes, gulped the nervousness, desperately trying to hide residual feelings and emotions still simmering beneath her skin. 




“You okay?” She tensed at the familiar touch of fingers to her wrist. Familiar in reality and now her fantasies. 




She shrugged off Ryan’s grip and shook herself. “Yeah. I just needed to clear my mind.” She glanced down at her Nikes. 




Ryan pulled back her hand, confused by Sophie’s reaction. “I get that. I’m doing the same, but walking. Not in the mood to be sweaty.” She shrugged, oblivious to the effect of her words on the taller woman standing rigidly in front of her, clenching her teeth and fists. 




“Oh.” She needed to get away from her. The urge to step closer battled with the panic to run and keep running until she couldn’t run anymore. “I’m gonna…” She gestured past Ryan and went to take a step, stumbling and dropping her phone. She steadied herself while Ryan bent to pick up her phone, glancing at her song choice. 




“Replay, huh?” Ryan handed the phone back. “Throwback Thursday?” 




“Something like that.” Sophie accepted her phone back trying not to touch her fingers. 




“I hit replay for you.” She smiled wiggling her eyebrows playfully. 




“Thanks.” Sophie’s cheeks and neck warmed. 




“Oh, that reminds me. Mary wants us to meet her at The Hold Up later for their Throwback Thursday themed DJ. Maybe we can request this song.” She put her own AirPods back into her ears and started to walk past her, gracing Sophie with her scent. “See ya later, Soph. Good luck with clearing your mind.” She called over her shoulder leaving Sophie standing in the middle of the pavement, Replay still playing in her ears. 




Wanna put this song on replay

We can start all over again

And again

Yeah

Wanna put this song on re-




“Fuck it.” She tapped the replay button and took off running again. She was fucked.","<p>Story Title: <strong>Replay</strong></p>

The urge to step closer battled with the panic to run and keep running until she couldn&rsquo;t run anymore. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna&hellip;&rdquo; She gestured past Ryan and went to take a step, stumbling and dropping her phone. She steadied herself while Ryan bent to pick up her phone, glancing at her song choice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<strong>Replay</strong>, huh?&rdquo; Ryan handed the phone back. &ldquo;Throwback Thursday?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something like that.&rdquo; Sophie accepted her phone back trying not to touch her fingers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hit replay for you.&rdquo; She smiled wiggling her eyebrows playfully.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo; Sophie&rsquo;s cheeks and neck warmed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that reminds me. Mary wants us to meet her at The Hold Up later for their Throwback Thursday themed DJ. Maybe we can request this song.&rdquo; She put her own AirPods back into her ears and started to walk past her, gracing Sophie with her scent. &ldquo;See ya later, Soph. Good luck with clearing your mind.&rdquo; She called over her shoulder leaving Sophie standing in the middle of the pavement, Replay still playing in her ears.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Wanna put this song on replay</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>We can start all over again</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>And again</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Yeah</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Wanna put this song on re-</em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fuck it.&rdquo; She tapped the replay button and took off running again. She was fucked.</p>","almag","","almag",1,"Replay by Zendaya","Replay by almag","<div><strong>Replay by Zendaya</strong></div><div>Replay by almag</div>",2023-02-15,"7d1CFwrBmH34gmS0Hkbfbt","7d1CFwrBmH34gmS0Hkbfbt?utm_source=generator",0,"https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d0000b2731beb69a81a1e66afbe5bbf75",0.688,0.723,6,-6.682,0,0.121,0.0416,"Story or Chapter Title, Played, Running","https://archiveofourown.org/works/45073042","2013-01-01","<a href=""https://archiveofourown.org/works/45073042"" target=""_blank""

Her tone sounded very much like ‘go on’ so Sophie did. “And we’re comfortable with each other, right?”

“Yeah, one hundred percent,” Ryan agreed without even really thinking about it. If she weren’t too busy comprehending and was instead going for her usual levels of head ass-ery (which was the maximum amount in Sophie’s opinion), she would have told Alexa to play Comfortable by H.E.R.

“Good,” Sophie smiled to herself. “Already a solid foundation for trying something new.”

“They got up here rather speedily don’t you think,” Luke was genuinely confused. Imani had broken through the door. They could hear the zombies on the other side but the door, well… not much had taken place since, “it could be possible that they exerted too much energy to get to the loft, inside, and finally to this door.”

“So, they’re tired?”

“Or refueling,” Luke proceeded to open a search engine on his phone, “it’s a bit concerning to consider the dead as either tired or refueling. They are, you know… dead.”

“Thanks, Captain Obvious,” Ryan released her fighting stance and turned to Mary. Sophie remained in place. 

“What are you doing? Now isn’t the time to let our guard down,” Sophie remained in position, eyes focused on the door.

Then you come around again and say

""Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change, trust me""

Remember how that lasted for a day?

I say, ""I hate you,"" we break up, you call me, ""I love you""

“Or we could focus on getting out of here?” she gently turns the taller woman’s face towards her. The impact of the touch rattles her. The moments flash before her eyes. The possibility of Sophie (all of them) but mostly Sophie. Ryan wasn’t one to sacrifice a life but the woman who grated each nerve and always had a witty comeback wasn’t about to die on her watch, “Mary, how long for the jet?”




I'm really gonna miss you picking fights

And me falling for it, screaming that I'm right

And you would hide away and find your peace of mind

With some indie record that's much cooler than mine

“Ryan, I know it feels like time is moving slowly but nothing could be further from the truth,” in Mary’s defense Ryan had repeatedly put this question forward… and by repeatedly, every 5-15 seconds. It was an anxious spiral.

“You’re going first!” It was an affirmative squarely directed at the taller woman.

“What? Ryan, now is NOT the time!” Mary knew what was happening.

“Why would we put our military marksman on the getaway aircraft first?” Luke was flabbergasted by Ryan’s suggestion.

“You bozos are so naive,” the words were both arrogant and slimey, “it’s painfully obvious.”

“What? To who?” perplexed. The brain of the operation was always perplexed by basic human behaviour…like feelings. 

Mary gasped, “Ryan… RYan… RYAN RYAN RYAN”

“Why are you shouting?”

“You have feelings!”




Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

You called me up again tonight, but

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

This time, I'm telling you, I'm telling you




“What?” Sophie, stumped by the statement.

The door hinges had begun to creak, “Oh god, oh god,” Luke imagined the misfire of timing, the fumbling decisions about to derail their rescue operation.

“Ryan, she has feelings,” Mary pointed nonchalantly between the two women. Ryan still hadn’t turned her attention away from the military marksperson. Her body wasn’t frozen; she was experiencing an avalanche of thoughts, “feelings for you.”

Sophie let out a maniacal giggle, “I know we are all mentally writing our life resignation speeches but…. Ryan is many things, but delusional isn’t one.”

Luke was spiraling in the corner, audibly counting the seconds until the jet’s arrival, “507, 506, 505, 504. 503, the universe, anybody don’t give up on me, 502, 501, 500, 499, 498.” 

“The coroner’s report will read: death by lesbian,” Alice pointed her words at the two Black women currently too distracted to realise that the door was mere moments from being completely broken down. 

“Soph…” she hesitated. What was she supposed to do now? She had been made by everyone in the room “I-”

“Ryan,” there was a sense of urgency.

“Soph”

“RYAN”

“Stop interrupting me!” She kissed her. Irrationally, hard then soft. She is on her toes; the shorter woman dragged her downwards. Sophie pushes her off.

“Ryan!” 

“I’m trying to tell you something!”

Sophie slapped her!

“What was that for?”.... “you don’t like me”

“Wrong time to ask that question?”

“We could die! This feels perfect if you ask me!”




We (We) are never, ever, ever getting back together

We are never, ever, ever getting back together

You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me (Talk to me)

But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together




“Are you going to kill Angelique?”

“What?”

The door crashes to the floor. Zombies come charging forward. Jada Jet’s plane is moving ever close. 

“Angelique! Shoot her!”

“Kate!”

“What?”

“Luke, remember what we practiced?” Ryan looked at their exes, hooks ups, and hangouts walking towards them. She wasn’t the best at relationships but she didn’t want to add the zombie apocalypse to the list of reasons she was single, “Luke, snap out of it!”

Sophie softened, “Kate, I know you’re in there.”




“I used to think that we were forever, ever

And I used to say, ""Never say never""

Ugh, so he calls me up and he's like, ""I still love you""

And I'm like, ""I just, I mean, this is exhausting, you know?

Like, we are never getting back together, like, ever""




Ryan lunges forward.

...

Writer's Beginning Notes:

Wildmoore and Thundergrace link up and Ryan makes a very special request

Song: So Into You by Tamia (https://youtu.be/yFTYzJYTHQA)

...

“What’s up Freeland?!” they heard the DJ over the speakers say. “I got a song request from a special guest here tonight. Miss CEO herself, Ryan Wilder from Gotham City is in the building. Make some noise!” the crowd screamed and cheered in response and Ryan couldn’t help but smile. She was more known than she thought. 

“Ry. Babe. What’s going on?”

“Just wait.”

“This goes out to Miss Wilder’s special lady and it’s a throwback slow jam so grab your special one and cuddle up on the dance floor.”

As the music began to play, Ryan stood up and offered her hand to Sophie. 

“May I have this dance?”

Still a little confused by what was happening but willing to go along it; Sophie nodded, took Ryan’s hand, and let Ryan pull her up. She pulled Sophie close, arms wrapping around her waist while Sophie rested her arms around Ryan’s neck. 

With every passing moment

Thoughts of you run through my head

Every time that I'm near you

I realize that you're heaven sent, baby

I think you're truly something special

Just what my dreams are really made of

Let's stay together you and me boy

There's no one like you around, oh, baby

With the life they both led, they didn’t get many moments like this one.

Is was nice.

As they swayed to the music, Ryan began softly singing along. 

“I really like what you've done to me. I can't really explain it, I'm so into you. I really like what you've done to me. I can't really explain it, I'm so into you.”

Sophie rested her head on the side of Ryan’s, vibing and listening while her girlfriend serenaded her. 

I really like

What I feel when I'm with you

You're a dream come true

Don't you ever leave my side

'Cause it feels so right

Oh, I really like what you've done to me

Oh, I can't really explain it, I'm so into you, baby

I really like what you've done to me

I can't really explain it, I'm so into you

As the song coasted to the end, the DJ was saying something but all Ryan could hear was her own pulse in her ears and feel Sophie’s heartbeat against her own chest. 

“Sophie?”  

“Mmm?” 

“I’m so into you.”

Sophie chuckled.

“I’m so into you too.”

Ryan took a deep breath.

“No. Um. Not just that. I’m so into you that I’m in love with you.”

Sophie stopped their swaying and leaned back to look at Ryan. And the look on her face was hard to read.

The longer the pause, the more Ryan wanted to sprint out of the club and catch the first available flight to the moon. Then Sophie slowly smiled.

“Fucking finally.” She said and Ryan couldn’t believe her ears.

“Wait. Finally?” 

“Ryan. I’ve wanting to say it for a few months now, but I didn’t want you feel like I was rushing things and then I’d scare you off. Again.” ","<p>Story Title: <strong>So Into You</strong></p>

<p>Wildmoore and Thundergrace link up and Ryan makes a very special request</p>
<p>Song: <strong>So Into You by Tamia</strong> (https://youtu.be/yFTYzJYTHQA)</p>
<p>...</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up Freeland?!&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;they heard the DJ over the speakers say. &ldquo;<em>I got a song request from a special guest here tonight. Miss CEO herself, Ryan Wilder from Gotham City is in the building. Make some noise!&rdquo;&nbsp;</em>the crowd screamed and cheered in response and Ryan couldn&rsquo;t help but smile. She was more known than she thought.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ry. Babe. What&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;This goes out to Miss Wilder&rsquo;s special lady and it&rsquo;s a throwback slow jam so grab your special one and cuddle up on the dance floor.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>As the music began to play, Ryan stood up and offered her hand to Sophie.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I have this dance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still a little confused by what was happening but willing to go along it; Sophie nodded, took Ryan&rsquo;s hand, and let Ryan pull her up. She pulled Sophie close, arms wrapping around her waist while Sophie rested her arms around Ryan&rsquo;s neck.&nbsp;</p>
<p align=""center""><strong><em>With every passing moment</em></strong></p>
<p align=""center""><strong><em>Thoughts of you run through my head</em></strong></p>
<p align=""center""><strong><em>Every time that I'm near you</em></strong></p>
<p align=""center""><strong><em>I realize that you're heaven sent, baby</em></strong></p>
<p align=""center""><strong><em>I think you're truly something special</em></strong></p>
<p align=""center""><strong><em>Just what my dreams are really made of</em></strong></p>
<p align=""center""><strong><em>Let's stay together you and me boy</em></strong></p>
<p align=""center""><strong><em>There's no one like you around, oh, baby</em></strong></p>
<p>With the life they both led, they didn&rsquo;t get many moments like this one.</p>
<p>Is was nice.</p>
<p>As they swayed to the music, Ryan began softly singing along.<em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;I really like what you've done to me. I can't really explain it, I'm so into you. I really like what you've done to me. I can't really explain it, I'm so into you.</strong>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sophie rested her head on the side of Ryan&rsquo;s, vibing and listening while her girlfriend serenaded her.&nbsp;</p>
<p align=""center""><strong><em>I really like</em></strong></p>
<p align=""center""><strong><em>What I feel when I'm with you</em></strong></p>
<p align=""center""><strong><em>You're a dream come true</em></strong></p>
<p align=""center""><strong><em>Don't you ever leave my side</em></strong></p>
<p align=""center""><strong><em>'Cause it feels so right</em></strong></p>
<p align=""center""><strong><em>Oh, I really like what you've done to me</em></strong></p>
<p align=""center""><strong><em>Oh, I can't really explain it, I'm so into you, baby</em></strong></p>
<p align=""center""><strong><em>I really like what you've done to me</em></strong></p>
<p align=""center""><strong><em>I can't really explain it, I'm so into you</em></strong></p>
<p>As the song coasted to the end, the DJ was saying something but all Ryan could hear was her own pulse in her ears and feel Sophie&rsquo;s heartbeat against her own chest.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sophie?&rdquo; &nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mmm?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so into you.&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>Sophie chuckled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<strong>I&rsquo;m so into you too.</strong>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ryan took a deep breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Um. Not just that. I&rsquo;m so into you that I&rsquo;m in love with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sophie stopped their swaying and leaned back to look at Ryan. And the look on her face was hard to read.</p>
<p>The longer the pause, the more Ryan wanted to sprint out of the club and catch the first available flight to the moon. Then Sophie slowly smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fucking finally.&rdquo; She said and Ryan couldn&rsquo;t believe her ears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait. Finally?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ryan. I&rsquo;ve wanting to say it for a few months now, but I didn&rsquo;t want you feel like I was rushing things and then I&rsquo;d scare you off. Again.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>","Jjharris2614","","Jjharris2614",1,"So Into You by Tamia","So Into You by Jjharris2614","<div><strong>So Into You by Tamia</strong></div><div>So Into You by Jjharris2614</div>",2023-02-17,"3c6afiysmB7OnxQzzSqRfD","3c6afiysmB7OnxQzzSqRfD?utm_source=generator",0,"https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d0000b273d3f287e73f69eb431ee17f50",0.656,0.479,7,-7.055,0,0.0348,0.0665,"Story or Chapter Title, Notes","https://archiveofourown.org/works/45116236","1998","<a href=""https://archiveofourown.org/works/45116236"" target=""_blank""

The timing and pacing along with the songs, press play after all the ingredients are prepped and ready, and the curl of the exclamation mark at the end. It’s a smile. A gentle message.”

Wooden spoon in your firefighting hand, pot on the stove. Let’s do this. 




Turn the fire on to medium. Press play




Add the oil at the end of the piano intro. Something always brings me back to you




You still feel me here til the moment I’m gone. Add the sausage and the ground beef




Use your spoon to gently break the sausage and ground beef up as it cooks. 




But you touch me for a little while and all my fragile strength is gone. Add the poblano pepper, onion, and celery.




Stir in the veggies.You’re everything I need here on the ground




Sway to the sound of the notes and the sizzle. Add chili powder, tomatoes, tomato sauce, and molasses, and mix well. Lift from the bottom of the pot. Use those muscles.




You’re on to me, on to me, and all over, something always brings me back to you

It never takes too long




Add the non-alcoholic stout, beef stock, garlic, Worcestershire, and vinegar




Me say mi love yuh like mango




Stir the spoon and swivel the sips




A better you gimme some loving 

See how far we can guh




Imagine it’d be nice and something 




Let the fire do what it do for 90 minutes




If you put your head my sleeve

Do you sing you asleep?

I wouldn’t tell a soul what you dream

I think you’d want me to know it’s like ivory




Add beans and cook and another 30 minutes. 




Bet you you'll see far

Bet you you'll see stars

Bet you you'll elevate

Bet you you'll meet God

'Cause I feel like fallin' in love

I'm in the mood to fuck somethin' up

'Cause we gon' fuck up the night





Stir




…




If you got the notion

I second that emotion

Said, if you feel like giving me a lifetime of devotion

I second that emotion




Stir

Wild, wild, wild

Wild, wild, wild thoughts

Wild, wild, wild

When I'm with you, all I get is wild thoughts

Wild, wild, wild

When I'm with you, all I get is wild thoughts




Stir




…




Well, now, it takes more than a robin to make the winter go

And it takes two lips of fire to melt away the snow

Well it takes two hearts a-cookin to make a fire grow

And baby, you’ve got what it takes




Stir




….

I was lost in transit

You, you found me stranded

I, I just can't stand it

You, you hit me just like

                                                      (Sophie repeats the song)

Stir




…

And the chemistry, the chemistry

It hit me like that, that, that

And the serotonin flutterin'

It hit me so bad




Like a sucker punch straight to my heart




Stir




…




Stir




…




You hold me without touch

You keep me without chains

I never wanted anything so much than to drown in your love




…




Stir 




…

Breathe.  Turn off the flame. You did it.

"Ivory","Omar Apollo","","","","Omar Apollo","Mississippi Flame","“You matter to someone,” Sophie’s face held a mellow and contented glow, “I hope you know that’s more than a recipe,” Sophie gives Danvers a curious look, “I can tell you don’t cook. You’ve been nervous this entire time which tells me you have not prepared a meal of any kind for anyone but yourself. The notes… “trust yourself” beside the adding of the chili powder. The timing and pacing along with the songs, press play after all the ingredients are prepped and ready, and the curl of the exclamation mark at the end. It’s a smile. A gentle message.” 

My Love,




Wooden spoon in your firefighting hand, pot on the stove. Let’s do this.

But you touch me for a little while and all my fragile strength is gone. Add the poblano pepper, onion, and celery.

"CUFF IT","Beyoncé","","","","Beyoncé","Mississippi Flame","“You matter to someone,” Sophie’s face held a mellow and contented glow, “I hope you know that’s more than a recipe,” Sophie gives Danvers a curious look, “I can tell you don’t cook. You’ve been nervous this entire time which tells me you have not prepared a meal of any kind for anyone but yourself. The notes… “trust yourself” beside the adding of the chili powder. The timing and pacing along with the songs, press play after all the ingredients are prepped and ready, and the curl of the exclamation mark at the end. It’s a smile. A gentle message.” 

My Love,




Wooden spoon in your firefighting hand, pot on the stove. Let’s do this. 




Turn the fire on to medium. Press play




Add the oil at the end of the piano intro. Something always brings me back to you




You still feel me here til the moment I’m gone. Add the sausage and the ground beef




Use your spoon to gently break the sausage and ground beef up as it cooks. 




But you touch me for a little while and all my fragile strength is gone. Add the poblano pepper, onion, and celery.




Stir in the veggies.You’re everything I need here on the ground




Sway to the sound of the notes and the sizzle. Add chili powder, tomatoes, tomato sauce, and molasses, and mix well. Lift from the bottom of the pot. Use those muscles.




You’re on to me, on to me, and all over, something always brings me back to you




Timer: 15 minutes.




It never takes too long




Add the non-alcoholic stout, beef stock, garlic, Worcestershire, and vinegar




Me say mi love yuh like mango




Stir the spoon and swivel the sips




A better you gimme some loving 

See how far we can guh




Imagine it’d be nice and something 




Let the fire do what it do for 90 minutes




If you put your head my sleeve

Do you sing you asleep?

I wouldn’t tell a soul what you dream

I think you’d want me to know it’s like ivory




Add beans and cook and another 30 minutes. 




Bet you you'll see far

Bet you you'll see stars

Bet you you'll elevate

Bet you you'll meet God

'Cause I feel like fallin' in love

I'm in the mood to fuck somethin' up

'Cause we gon' fuck up the night





Stir




…




If you got the notion

I second that emotion

Said, if you feel like giving me a lifetime of devotion

I second that emotion




Stir




…




Wild, wild, wild

Wild, wild, wild thoughts

Wild, wild, wild

When I'm with you, all I get is wild thoughts

Wild, wild, wild

When I'm with you, all I get is wild thoughts




Stir




…




Well, now, it takes more than a robin to make the winter go

And it takes two lips of fire to melt away the snow

Well it takes two hearts a-cookin to make a fire grow

And baby, you’ve got what it takes




Stir




….

I was lost in transit

You, you found me stranded

I, I just can't stand it

You, you hit me just like

                                                      (Sophie repeats the song)

Stir




…

And the chemistry, the chemistry

It hit me like that, that, that

And the serotonin flutterin'

It hit me so bad




Like a sucker punch straight to my heart




Stir




…




Stir




…




You hold me without touch

You keep me without chains

I never wanted anything so much than to drown in your love




…




Stir 




…

Breathe.  Turn off the flame. You did it.

My Love,




Wooden spoon in your firefighting hand, pot on the stove. Let’s do this. 




Turn the fire on to medium. Press play




Add the oil at the end of the piano intro. Something always brings me back to you




You still feel me here til the moment I’m gone. Add the sausage and the ground beef




Use your spoon to gently break the sausage and ground beef up as it cooks. 




But you touch me for a little while and all my fragile strength is gone. Add the poblano pepper, onion, and celery.




Stir in the veggies.You’re everything I need here on the ground




Sway to the sound of the notes and the sizzle. Add chili powder, tomatoes, tomato sauce, and molasses, and mix well. Lift from the bottom of the pot. Use those muscles.




You’re on to me, on to me, and all over, something always brings me back to you




Timer: 15 minutes.




It never takes too long




Add the non-alcoholic stout, beef stock, garlic, Worcestershire, and vinegar




Me say mi love yuh like mango




Stir the spoon and swivel the sips




A better you gimme some loving 

See how far we can guh




Imagine it’d be nice and something 




Let the fire do what it do for 90 minutes




If you put your head my sleeve

Do you sing you asleep?

I wouldn’t tell a soul what you dream

I think you’d want me to know it’s like ivory




Add beans and cook and another 30 minutes. 




Bet you you'll see far

Bet you you'll see stars

Bet you you'll elevate

Bet you you'll meet God

'Cause I feel like fallin' in love

I'm in the mood to fuck somethin' up

'Cause we gon' fuck up the night





Stir




…




If you got the notion

I second that emotion

Said, if you feel like giving me a lifetime of devotion

I second that emotion




Stir




…




Wild, wild, wild

Wild, wild, wild thoughts

Wild, wild, wild

When I'm with you, all I get is wild thoughts

Wild, wild, wild

When I'm with you, all I get is wild thoughts




Stir




…




Well, now, it takes more than a robin to make the winter go

And it takes two lips of fire to melt away the snow

Well it takes two hearts a-cookin to make a fire grow

And baby, you’ve got what it takes




Stir




….

I was lost in transit

You, you found me stranded

I, I just can't stand it

You, you hit me just like

                                                      (Sophie repeats the song)

Stir




…

And the chemistry, the chemistry

It hit me like that, that, that

It hit me so bad

"Suckerpunch","FLETCHER","","","","FLETCHER","Mississippi Flame","“You matter to someone,” Sophie’s face held a mellow and contented glow, “I hope you know that’s more than a recipe,” Sophie gives Danvers a curious look, “I can tell you don’t cook. You’ve been nervous this entire time which tells me you have not prepared a meal of any kind for anyone but yourself. The notes… “trust yourself” beside the adding of the chili powder. The timing and pacing along with the songs, press play after all the ingredients are prepped and ready, and the curl of the exclamation mark at the end. It’s a smile. A gentle message.” 

My Love,




Wooden spoon in your firefighting hand, pot on the stove. Let’s do this. 




Turn the fire on to medium. Press play




Add the oil at the end of the piano intro. Something always brings me back to you




You still feel me here til the moment I’m gone. Add the sausage and the ground beef




Use your spoon to gently break the sausage and ground beef up as it cooks. 




But you touch me for a little while and all my fragile strength is gone. Add the poblano pepper, onion, and celery.




Stir in the veggies.You’re everything I need here on the ground




Sway to the sound of the notes and the sizzle. Add chili powder, tomatoes, tomato sauce, and molasses, and mix well. Lift from the bottom of the pot. Use those muscles.




You’re on to me, on to me, and all over, something always brings me back to you




Timer: 15 minutes.




It never takes too long




Add the non-alcoholic stout, beef stock, garlic, Worcestershire, and vinegar




Me say mi love yuh like mango




Stir the spoon and swivel the sips




A better you gimme some loving 

See how far we can guh




Imagine it’d be nice and something 




Let the fire do what it do for 90 minutes




If you put your head my sleeve

Do you sing you asleep?

I wouldn’t tell a soul what you dream

I think you’d want me to know it’s like ivory




Add beans and cook and another 30 minutes. 




Bet you you'll see far

Bet you you'll see stars

Bet you you'll elevate

Bet you you'll meet God

'Cause I feel like fallin' in love

I'm in the mood to fuck somethin' up

'Cause we gon' fuck up the night





Stir




…




If you got the notion

I second that emotion

Said, if you feel like giving me a lifetime of devotion

I second that emotion




Stir




…




Wild, wild, wild

Wild, wild, wild thoughts

Wild, wild, wild

When I'm with you, all I get is wild thoughts

Wild, wild, wild

When I'm with you, all I get is wild thoughts




Stir




…




Well, now, it takes more than a robin to make the winter go

And it takes two lips of fire to melt away the snow

Well it takes two hearts a-cookin to make a fire grow

And baby, you’ve got what it takes




Stir




….

I was lost in transit

You, you found me stranded

I, I just can't stand it

You, you hit me just like

                                                      (Sophie repeats the song)

Stir




…

And the chemistry, the chemistry

It hit me like that, that, that

And the serotonin flutterin'

It hit me so bad




Like a sucker punch straight to my heart




Stir




…




Stir




…




You hold me without touch

You keep me without chains

I never wanted anything so much than to drown in your love




…




Stir 




…

Breathe.  Turn off the flame. You did it.

"Hot In Herre","Nelly","","","","Nelly","Wildmoore Flash fics","Chapter Title: Hot in Here

Ryan stumbled into the apartment. She dropped her keys on the floor. The result of inebriation, poor balance, and terrible aim. She hadn’t been out in weeks as Gotham was experiencing a crime wave— Arkham had a few escaped residents. 

“Sophie!” She stumbled into the living space. She belched loudly, catching herself off guard. She sniffed, “oh yea. Crispy Joe’s wontons. Those were tasty.” She felt uncomfortable, “right, shoes.” She took her heels off and threw them towards the door. One of her black pumps hit the apartment door causing a loud thud. She slithered out of her skin-tight dress as she sang to herself.

“I was like good gracious ass is bodacious, uh flirtatious, trying to show faces,” Ryan was dancing, wobbly but still sultry enough for Sophie to stop in the doorway and enjoy the show before announcing that she was indeed awoken by her drunk lover, “looking for the right time to shoot my steam, you know, looking for the right time to flash them keys,” she stepped out of her dressed. She was running her hands through her hair as she danced. Sophie leaned against the wall in the apartment hallway, “then um, I’m leaving, please believing, oh me and the rest of my heathens,” Sophie was catching the beat and proceeded to join Ryan as she removed her push-up bra.

“Check it, got it locked at the top of the Four Seasons,” Sophie was wearing a yellow waffle knit cami bralette top with matching shorts. It was cute cozy and perfect for a sudden late-night dance-party-sing-a-long, “penthouse, rooftop, birds I feeding, no deceiving, nothing up my sleeve no teasing,” she ran her index finger down Ryan’s chest as they rapped and moved their bodies in sync, “I need you to get up up on the dance floor give that man what he asking for because I feel like cutting loose and I feel like touching you,” the two women’s eyes were locked and focused on each other, “uh uh and can’t nobody stop the juice so baby tell me what’s the use.”

Sophie lifted Ryan off the ground, and a heated kiss followed. Ryan pulled back, biting her lips, “it’s getting hot in here so take off all your clothes. I am getting so hot–”

“I want to take my clothes off.” 

Sophie carried Ryan to their bedroom, tossing her on the bed— a move that proved to have disastrous consequences. It shifted Ryan’s stomach. Sophie removed her pyjama top as Ryan barely made it to their en suite toilet in time. Sophie could hear the painful hurl escape Ryan’s body.

Sophie quietly put her top back on and climbed into bed. Ryan brushed her teeth and drank some water. She came dancing back into the bedroom, “it’s getting hot in herree.” 

“Nope.” 

“Babbbeeee… I brushed my teeth tho.”

“Nope.”

Ryan climbed into the bed trying other methods to reengage Sophie in their pre-interruption activities, “can you resist this?” Ryan took Sophie’s earlobe between her teeth, running her hand along Sophie’s inner thigh.

“Yes,” as she removed Ryan’s hand, “I absolutely can; I can absolutely can.”

“But…” Ryan huffed and slunk into bed. 

“I brushed my teeth,” she mumbled under her breath.

It wasn’t long before Ryan was asleep and snoring. Sophie turned around to spoon the woman sure to be nursing a hangover in the morning. 

She kissed her cheek, “I love you, puke face.”","<p>Chapter Title: <strong>Hot in Here</strong></p>

"Talk About It","Jake Isaac","Yuna","","","Jake Isaac, Yuna","No Good Deed","Especially, not when more lights were turned onto the choir behind her as they joined her for the chorus.

Let's talk about it, let′s talk about it
The way it hurts
The way it hides behind our words
When we don′t want to say what's wrong
Can we talk about it before the love′s gone?

Ryan turned to Iris with a raised eyebrow. She didn't want to say what she was thinking outloud, lest she look like a self-centered psychopath, but luckily Iris turned to her with the same expression.

""Is this fucking song about me?""

Iris patted her velvet-clad knee, ""Baby, all her songs are about you.""

Ryan felt like that might have been a stretch but she was increasingly glad she planned on speaking with Sophie later on in the night.","<p>Writer's Beginning Notes:</p>
<p>And the song sophie sings is <strong>Talk About It by Jake Issac and Yuna</strong></p>
<p>...</p>
<p>She was onstage before the lights came up as was standard. Less standard was the fact that she had to sing a full verse before a singular yellow spotlight shown down on her.</p>
<p><strong><em>Don&prime;t walk away 'cause if you go, I might not stay<br />No, don&prime;t you leave<br />You had enough and I can see<br />That our talk has turned to madness<br />It's become so cold and quietly</em></strong></p>
<p>It often helped that she couldn't see anything when performing on stage. The bright lights did not really make for any viewing pleasure.</p>
<p>Especially, not when more lights were turned onto the choir behind her as they joined her for the chorus.</p>
<p><strong><em>Let's talk about it, let&prime;s talk about it<br />The way it hurts<br />The way it hides behind our words<br />When we don&prime;t want to say what's wrong<br />Can we talk about it before the love&prime;s gone?</em></strong></p>

Sophie leaned in and captured Ryan’s lips with her own. “I’m yours Ryan… every single part of me for as long as you’ll have me.”

Ryan swallowed the emotion welling within her. Sophie always had a way with words. “I thought we already settled this.  In the words of the great Beyonce’ Knowles-Carter, I liked it so I put a ring on it.  You’re mine until we’re both old and dusty.”

Sophie snorted.  “You better speak for yourself. I’m not going to be dusty. I have good genes.” She said gesturing to herself. 

Ryan stepped back and looked at her from head to toe.  She had to admit that Sophie did look good.  She was wearing a simple pair of white linen pants with a matching white button down.  Her hair was hanging freely over her shoulders, blowing in the gentle breeze.  She looked breathtaking.

“I plan to age gracefully.  And if your mother is any indicator of how you’ll age, you won’t have anything to worry about either.”

"We Are The Champions","Queen","","","","Queen","Christmas Wishes","Ryan finally gave up and joined her.  Jada laughed and brushed snow out of Ryan’s hair.  “You look a mess… and extremely happy, baby girl.”

“I am deliriously happy.” Ryan said wistfully as she watched her family and friends play in the snow.  Her eyes found Sophie and Charlie behind a tree.  Charlie was stockpiling snowballs as Sophie pelted Jordan and Marquis in the face.  Luke tripped over his own feet and landed face first in the snow.  Mary was laughing too hard to help him up.  Ryan and Jada laughed out loud.

“They make quite the team, don’t they?”

“They do.  Did you hear her call Sophie mommy?”

“I did.  I didn’t think there was anyone other than you that could wrap that woman around their finger.  I think your baby girl is going to give you a run for your money, dear.”

Ryan thought for a moment.  She liked the sound of that.  Charlie was their baby girl just like she was Jada’s.

“We got them, Mommy!  We won!” Charlies high pitched voice rang out into the starry night.

Ryan watched as Sophie lifted Charlie onto her shoulders as they trotted around celebrating their victory in song.  “We are the champions! We are the champions! No time for losers cause we are the champions... of the world!”

“So, how does it feel to finally have the family you always wanted?” Jada asked quietly.

Ryan looked at her mother for a moment before draping an arm around her shoulder.  Jada wrapped an arm around Ryan’s waist.

Another crowing piercing scream

<p>Ryan whispered to Sophie. ""You're so beautiful,"" which made her blush. Sophie kissed her in response, because she didn&rsquo;t have the words to describe how she was feeling. The way Ryan was looking at her filled her with so many emotions that she felt overwhelmed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you get us another round?&rdquo; Ryan asked her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you trying to get me drunk so you can have your way with me?&rdquo; Sophie teased.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo; Ryan grinned.</p>
<p>Sophie chuckled, softly, and gave Ryan another quick kiss before she went over to the bar. Jordan noticed all of a sudden Ryan seemed to get nervous. She took a deep breath, and reached into the pocket of the flannel shirt she wore. At first, she couldn&rsquo;t tell what was in her hand until Ryan adjusted what she was holding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh my god,&rdquo; Jordan gasped and eagerly nudged Mary next to her, who squealed.</p>
<p>Sophie could hear the gasp and whispers behind her, which made her turn around. Immediately she was caught off guard when she saw Ryan standing there holding a ring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t sure when, or how I was going to do this. I was waiting for the perfect moment, but there is no such thing,&rdquo; Ryan began, her voice trembling with emotion. The look in Sophie&rsquo;s eyes made her feel even more emotional. ""Sophie, from the moment we met, I knew there was something special between us. Through everything, even in my darkest moments, the one thing I could never get away from was how much I love you, and I can't imagine my life without you in it. I want to spend the rest of my life showing you how much you mean to me. Life is so unpredictable, we don&rsquo;t know how much time we have, and we're reminded of it every day. I want to make every single moment with you count. So, Sophie, will you do me the honor of becoming my wife?""</p>
<p>Tears welled up in Sophie's eyes, her heart swelling with so many overjoyed emotions. Words that described what she was feeling escaped her, so she simply nodded vigorously until she managed to choke out a heartfelt, ""Yes, Ryan, yes! I will marry you baby!""</p>
<p>The room erupted in cheers and applause from their friends, and strangers onlooking who were overjoyed for them. Ryan slipped the ring onto Sophie's finger, and they shared a passionate and emotional kiss that seemed to last forever.</p>","BWildmoore","","BWildmoore",6,"ICU by Coco Jones","Fire and Desire by BWildmoore","<div><strong>ICU by Coco Jones</strong></div><div>Fire and Desire by BWildmoore</div>",2023-04-28,"58cMDjQSUdWJUgFmHxRhjt","58cMDjQSUdWJUgFmHxRhjt?utm_source=generator",0,"https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d0000b27369e05883432893d1b3739c09",0.587,0.447,8,-6.765,1,0.0641,0.698,"Dancing, Club, Bar, Proposal","https://archiveofourown.org/works/46447171/chapters/116946544","2022-11-04","<a href=""https://archiveofourown.org/works/46447171/chapters/116946544"" target=""_blank""

Chapter Summary:

I wanna tell you how I feel tonight
I keep trying, but the words ain't right
Nothing's fitting for a kind like you
I'm never speechless when the earth's my view

-Love from NGC 7318, Tanerélle

Ryan swallowed thickly and opened the ring box she held. ""Sophia Diana Moore…will you marry me?""

The word yes felt stuck in Sophie's throat, and she couldn't seem to get the word out no matter how hard she tried, so she did the only thing she could think of, which was to kneel in front of Ryan and kiss her. She felt her tears falling and mixing with Ryan's as she poured a thousand 'yeses' into her kiss. When they parted, Sophie was still crying, but was able to nod, the closest she could get to forming the word she so desperately wanted to say but could not, for the life of her, get to come out.

<p>Chapter Summary:</p>
<p><strong>I wanna tell you how I feel tonight</strong><br /><strong>I keep trying, but the words ain't right</strong><br /><strong>Nothing's fitting for a kind like you</strong><br /><strong>I'm never speechless when the earth's my view</strong></p>
<p><strong>-Love from NGC 7318, Taner&eacute;lle</strong></p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Ryan swallowed thickly and opened the ring box she held. ""Sophia Diana Moore&hellip;will you marry me?""</p>
<p>The word yes felt stuck in Sophie's throat, and she couldn't seem to get the word out no matter how hard she tried, so she did the only thing she could think of, which was to kneel in front of Ryan and kiss her. She felt her tears falling and mixing with Ryan's as she poured a thousand 'yeses' into her kiss. When they parted, Sophie was still crying, but was able to nod, the closest she could get to forming the word she so desperately wanted to say but could not, for the life of her, get to come out.</p>

They laughed, sang along, and cried throughout the musical. The bourbon had long since been abandoned, both women pleasantly buzzed and warm. The throw blanket Sophie used earlier covered them both as they cuddled together, Sophie's arm looped in Ryan's. Towards the end of the film, the opening notes of <strong>Finale B</strong> began playing and Sophie softly sang along.&nbsp;</p>

Ryan raised a brow.  “And you think you do?”

“Oh, I can only pray and hope.” Sophie said so sincerely, it took Ryan’s breath away.

Conversation flowed easily between them as dinner was consumed.  They talked about everything; nothing was off limits.  Following dessert, Sophie stood and held out her hand.  “Usually, a date includes dancing.  May I?”

“Mmhmm… I’m not a player. I just crush a lot.” Ryan mumbled the song lyric.

Sophie just shook her head as Ran stepped into her taller frame and looped her arms around her neck.  Sophie’s hands slid around her waist and pulled her close.  Sophie lowered her head, touching their foreheads together.  They both sighed, feeling at home. 

“We’re not moving.” Ryan whispered after a while.

“We’re not?  It feels like we’re floating.”

 Ryan’s eyes drifted to Sophie’s plump lips.  She bit her own lip and groaned.  “If you want to dance, you’d better start moving otherwise, I’m about to kiss you and this museum is going to hold special meaning to me for a whole different reason.”

Sophie looked like she was ready to risk it all but held back.  They had plenty of time for that.  This night was about giving Ryan a first date that she would remember years from now.  The mere fact that she was thinking about the future made Sophie even more certain that this thing with Ryan was more than just attraction.  She knew she wanted to have a million firsts with Ryan.

She started swaying them to the music, just enjoying the feel of Ryan in her arms.  They danced for what felt like forever then walked the museum halls, listening and taking in Ryan’s enthusiasm as she talked about different pieces.  By the end of the night, Ryan was practically bubbling.  She was still talking about one of the modern paintings and its meaning.  Sophie found it adorable and sexy that Ryan was a secret Art and History geek. ","<p><em>&ldquo;First of all, Imani&hellip; come on.

<p>&ldquo;Hi. I didn&rsquo;t know dinner would include entertainment tonight.&nbsp; Motown, huh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charlie and I thought we could use a little music while we made dinner.&nbsp; I realized I have failed to teach her about Motown, so I had to teach her my favorite song. &nbsp;Every girl should know&nbsp;<strong><em>My Girl</em>&nbsp;by The Temptations</strong>.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a Motown classic.&rdquo;</p>

The breakfast consisted of fluffy sweet potato pancakes with a hint of cinnamon and nutmeg, crispy bacon cooked to perfection for Sophie, accompanied by scrambled eggs seasoned with a touch of fresh herbs. For herself, Ryan prepared avocado toast topped with thinly sliced radishes and sprouts, along with a vegan egg substitute. To complete the meal, that was going to be a surprise for Sophie, was an assortment of fresh fruit, including strawberries, blueberries, and Sophie&rsquo;s favorite, sweet, succulent pineapples. The aroma of the food carried through the apartment, creating a hungry invitation that caused Sophie to stir in their bedroom. While Ryan cooked, she couldn't help but hum to herself.</p>

<p>Jordan caught the bouquet, which she was sure her sister and sister-in-law threw directly at her. Ryan and Sophie had their first dance to <strong>John Legend&rsquo;s song So High</strong>. It had been on both their lists. They even danced with their mothers, and half way through the song, they switched and danced with their mother-in-laws.</p>

"We Might Even Be Falling In Love (Interlude)","Victoria Monét","","","","Victoria Monét","A Perfect Verse Over A Tight Beat","Victoria looked at the screen and saw all the songs except for one song that she didn’t record. Victoria played the song and the instrumental came on. Victoria heard guitar chords along with a 1970s beat. She was bobbing her head to the beat when Ryan stopped the song playing.

“Sorry, that’s not supposed to be there.”

“No, I love the beat. What is this?” Victoria asked excitedly.

“It’s just something I was playing around with.”

“A song that you’re playing around with called ‘We Might Even be Falling In Love’.” Victoria asked.

Ryan didn’t say anything.

“Are there lyrics to go with this song?”

“I’m not a writer.” Ryan stated.

“Yet, you have a song aptly titled ‘We Might Even be Falling In Love’.” Victoria countered. “If you named the song then there are lyrics to follow.”

Ryan stared at her before reaching for her phone to go to the Notes app to pull up the lyrics. She gave Victoria her phone as she silently read the lyrics. After she finished she looked up at Ryan and smiled.

“This is for her.” Victoria probed.

“For who? I just had these lyrics on my mind and had to write it down.” Ryan lied.

“Okay.” Victoria said unconvinced. “You should let me record it.”

“Why?” Ryan asked.

“Because this beat and those lyrics are meant to be heard even if it’s just you and me.”

Ryan shook her head. “I don’t know about that.”

“Let’s just see how it sounds. If you don’t like it then no harm no foul but I think you may have something special there, Ryan.”

“Oh you’re good.” Ryan said smiling.

“What did I do?” Victoria asked innocently.

“You know what you’re doing. You’re trying to stroke my ego.”

Victoria smiled. “Is it working?”

Ryan rolled her eyes. “Ugh, yes. Go get in the booth before I change my mind.”

“Yes.” Victoria said excitedly as she ran into the studio. “Send the lyrics to my phone.”

Ryan texted her the lyrics. As she set up the soundboard Victoria was in the booth trying to find the melody for the lyrics. After about ten minutes she was done.

“Are you ready?” Ryan asked.

“Are you?” Victoria countered as she put on the headphones.

Ryan smiled as she started the song.

Victoria closed her eyes and got lost into the beat of the song. Twelve seconds in Victoria started singing over the beat.

“Go 'head, act a fool in it
Freestyle with me 'til you find your groove in it
U-Haul 'cause I might let you move in it
Cause I ain't had nobody hit it like you hit it
And it feels like
I'm gonna know you for the rest of my life
It's safe to say that we might even be falling in love
Ooh, love, love, love
Ooh, love, love, love”

Ryan was in awe as Victoria sung the lyrics to her song. She knew the lyrics were good but Victoria just made them better and did it in one take.

“What did you think? Do you want me to go again?” Victoria asked.

“No, that was incredible.” Ryan marveled.

Victoria jumped up and left the booth to come back into the studio. After tinkering around with the song. Ryan played the song throughout the studio and they both screamed in excitement.

Always chasing the high, nevermind the fact that she burns off alcohol quicker than the average person does, she Sips on her glass of old fashioned, seeking the lasting burn from the beverage that never comes.

 

The bar she's sitting in is fairly empty so she slips the vial of fluorescent blue liquid from her leather jacket pocket, tipping The contents  into her drink, to add a little….razzle dazzle. The next few sip of her glass sends all her senses into a heightened frenzy. This, this is the high she's been searching for. She gulps down the rest of her glass and stumbles through the exit of the bar, heading down the road.

She sings at the top of her lungs, as off key as her body is off balance. She takes a few tumbles to the ground before she finally finds her footing, albeit clumsily. 

 

The hairs along her arms stand at attention, her blood bubbles with excitement, her ears hone in on almost every sounds she could possibly hear, she smells the greasy food being prepared in all the fast food restaurants in close proximity, she hears every laughter, every smashed glass, alcoholic drinks being mixed in shakers. This is what she's been craving and her body loves it, the constant rush of adrenaline.

Her return was far from ideal, but she had no other options and Jordan was the only family she had left. Living in Gotham again definitely hadn't been part of the plan, but plans have a way of getting derailed - or blowing up in your face, as was the case for her.

<p>""Mhmm, tell that to someone who'll listen. I know how Sophie Moore operates.""</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sophie rolled her eyes but stayed focused on driving.</p>

<p>Jordan nudged her playfully. ""Just don't bring any skanks back to my place.""</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;""C'mon Jor, I would never.""</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>""I know, I'm just playing."" After a brief pause, she added, ""What happened with that girl you were dating in Central City? Kim something?""</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Sophie just shrugged noncommittally and continued driving them to Jordan's apartment. She was crashing on her sister's couch for the time being, ever since moving back a few weeks ago. Her return was far from ideal, but she had no other options and Jordan was the only family she had left. Living in Gotham again definitely hadn't been part of the plan, but plans have a way of getting derailed - or blowing up in your face, as was the case for her.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sophie adjusted in her seat and navigated through the familiar streets as the melancholy melodies of ""<strong>Melt Away</strong>"" by <strong>Alicks</strong> filled the silence.</p>","AdultishGambino","","AdultishGambino",1,"Melt Away by Alicks","Night Rider by AdultishGambino","<div><strong>Melt Away by Alicks</strong></div><div>Night Rider by AdultishGambino</div>",2023-11-30,"33UeSzEAwtua1rd9Kgexvf","33UeSzEAwtua1rd9Kgexvf?utm_source=generator",0,"https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d0000b2734600f2625644736d2f4705d8",0.424,0.266,4,-14.364,1,0.0443,0.64,"Played, Car","https://archiveofourown.org/works/51928849/chapters/131310550","2019-01-10","<a href=""https://archiveofourown.org/works/51928849/chapters/131310550"" target=""_blank""

It’s a pretty great workout if I do say so myself.”

“Yeah, sure thing.” Ryan’s not entirely sure why she even agreed. She’s never stepped foot in a spin class much preferring Yoga and even that she does in the comfort of her own home and not in a room full of others. Although her therapist has been encouraging her to get out of her comfort zone more but hey she just moved to a completely new city so she thinks that qualifies.

“Well, I better get going.” Sophie gestures towards the class which looks almost completely filled by now.

“See ya around,” Ryan responds as Sophie turns to enter the room.

Ryan begins to make her way down the hall when she hears the muffled bass line of Victoria Monet’s Alright blasting from the room. Whoever is in charge of the playlist has excellent taste. Maybe it wouldn’t hurt to take a peek at the schedule and sign up for a class especially if that means she gets to see Sophie again.","<p>Sophie drops Ryan&rsquo;s hand and Ryan notices the loss immediately. &ldquo;Well if you ever change your mind about checking out the class first hand feel free to view the schedule online or in the lobby and join us one day.

“That’s an understatement. Safe to say I haven’t been there in a few months. Just thought it best to avoid it though I hear she’s skipped town now.”

"Level Up","Ciara","","","","Ciara","Spin Again","Ryan scrunches up her face at the thought of possibly trying that celery, cucumber, and ginger concoction that Sophie always orders, but she quickly brushes the worry aside. She’s pretty sure that she can top the leaderboard while getting her best score to date. The Power Meter, as Sophie explained to her during their first class, measures how much work the rider is putting into the bike (resistance) and the rate at which that work is being done (cadence). While the leaderboard is there to help keep people motivated with a goal to work towards it also serves as a little friendly competition between the participants. Ryan’s been tracking her score the past few weeks and she’s come a long way from her spot near the bottom half of class when she first started spinning. Lately, she’s been in 3rd or 4th place, still behind Sophie in the standings, but she’s positive she can take the top spot today, especially with the added incentive.

Ryan’s so busy psyching herself up to win that she barely notices Sophie has left her side and is walking towards the front of the room straight to the instructor's bike.

Sophie hops on and after some quick adjustments places a headset mic on. “Hey everyone! I’m filling in for our usual instructor Allison. Unfortunately, she had a last-minute thing pop up so you guys get me today. Hopefully, you don’t mind,” she finishes as she puts on her most charming megawatt smile.

Sophie’s announcement is met with smiles and nods from the class but Ryan is stuck in place. What in the entire fuck? She was expecting Sophie to be on the bike next to her not leading class. How is she supposed to concentrate now with Sophie directly in her sightline, giving instructions, muscles flexing, sweat glistening? It’s as if Sophie can read her mind as she chooses that exact moment to look directly at Ryan to shoot her a knowing smirk. It’s going to take all of Ryan’s resolve to reach the top of the rankings with this new wrinkle thrown in, but she refuses to back down now. She gives Sophie a thumbs up before the lights dim and the opening of Ciara’s Level Up begins. Appropriate song choice Ryan thinks as she puts her game face on - it’s go time.","<p>Ryan scrunches up her face at the thought of possibly trying that celery, cucumber, and ginger concoction that Sophie always orders, but she quickly brushes the worry aside.

""I'm still getting the hang of this thing. But you mentioned you don't listen to music when you drive, which is just crazy to me."" Ryan fiddled with the high-tech infotainment system and scrolling through screens. She glanced over at Sophie. ""So as long as you are in my car, I'm requiring we listen to something right now. Go ahead and pick a song.""




Sophie scoffed. ""Wow, not only am I being held hostage, but I must also be your DJ against my will? Is this what our friendship is going to be? Do I get no say?""




""Girl, just pick a song,"" Ryan laughed.




Sophie mumbled under her breath, ""So damn bossy,"" as she scrolled through the Spotify app integrated into the car. After some contemplation, she chose ""Smoking in the Park"" by Tone Smith.




Ryan bopped her head approvingly and increased the volume slightly as they cruised, following the curving highway lined with bright streetlights. ""What you know about Tone?""




""Not much, honestly. He stopped by the shop about a week ago while touring through Gotham. Said he heard about my skills from folks around town and needed some work done on his tour bus.""




Ryan's eyebrows raised, impressed that an artist with fame and status had sought out Sophie specifically. ""Well, clearly, your talent precedes you if celebrities come calling for your expertise.""




""I just try to provide quality work for whoever comes by the shop."" But internally, she did feel a sense of pride that her dedicated grinding has earned her a respected reputation in the industry. Ryan could sense Sophie's humility about her skills, which she found even more attractive.




As the sweet melodies continued to play out, the mood in the car shifted, becoming more relaxed and intimate.","<p>Writer's Beginning Notes:</p>

<p>Back in the car, Sophie pulled back her injured hand from Ryan's smack. She wonders if the little one knew how strong she was.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>""No one turns off <strong>Mary J.</strong>,"" Ryan continued, sliding the music volume back up. ""Her vibes are perfect for this long-ass drive.""</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>""Fine, you win. I'll just sit here and be a passenger princess like you clearly want.""</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ryan couldn't help but to absorb the lyrics. The words seemed to echo her own feelings for Sophie, resonating deep within her heart. Sophie, too, seemed to latch on to the song's verses. The joy they brought to each other made them feel like they were in their own little world of happiness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>""To be with you would be like paradise<br />Everything would be so nice, so right<br />The joy you bring to me makes me feel so<br />Good inside<br />It's so right, so high<br />Just thinkin' about you<br />And my feelings I just can't hide""</em></strong></p>

"My First Love","Avant","KeKe Wyatt","","","Avant, KeKe Wyatt","The Parent Trap","The night continued with laughter, shared stories, and a few more drinks. With R&B music playing softly in the background, Ryan and Sophie moved closer as they sipped their drinks.

Soon the energy in the room would change as the soulful melody of ""My First Love"" by Avant and Keke Wyatt filled the room, Sophie couldn't resist the magnetic pull of the music. With an impromptu smile, Sophie allowed herself to be transported back to moments that resonated with the lyrics of the song.

Sophie's movements began with a gentle sway, her body moving to the rhythm of the music. Sophie closed her eyes briefly as Ryan watched her and was enchanting by her beauty. Sophie spinned around on the floor by herself before turning to Ryan extending her hand out to dance with her. The room seemed to hold its breath for a moment as their eyes met. Ryan eyed her curiously.

""You’re going to leave me hanging?"" Sophie asked.

Ryan melted into a warm smile as she accepted Sophie's outstretched hand. Sophie pulled Ryan close as the electricity pulsed between them.

“This song reminds me of the first girl I fell in love with, Taylor Strickland.”

Ryan looked at Sophie. “What happened?”

“She wanted me to come out and I wasn’t ready until college. Then she found herself in college and wanted to explore her sexuality more. I understand now but eighteen year old Sophie wasn’t trying to hear that.”

Ryan chuckled. “I understand. Angelique Devereaux was mine. When I say everything toxic and wrong for one person packaged in a 5'5 stature it was all her.”

“Why did you stay with her when you knew she was not good for you?” Sophie asked as they continued to sway.

“You know how something is wrong for you but you still go for it because the rush excites you.”

Sophie nodded.

“That’s how it felt with her.”

“What about right now? What do you feel?” Sophie asked as she leaned in close to Ryan.

Their eyes locked, communicating a shared understanding that went beyond words. Sophie's hand gently cupped Ryan's cheek, her thumb tracing the outline of her face. Sophie gently pulled Ryan to her as their lips drew closer, the world outside faded away.

The kiss started slow as their lips brushed against each other as they explored each other's mouths. They didn’t know how long they were kissing as they pulled away, a shared breath lingering between them. The chemistry between Sophie and Ryan was strong that both were terrified of the emotions they were feeling. This was stronger than what either of them has felt for anyone.

As the song ended, Ryan and Sophie backed up slowly from each other to retreat to opposite corners. The kiss threw them both for a loop and they did not know how to react afterwards. What does this mean for them going forward? They kissed before without knowing each other but now that they know more about each other their feelings were stronger. Were they willing to take a risk that could eventually affect the lives of their daughters? Ryan and Sophie must have had the same thought as they took one look at each other and walked back to embrace once more as their lips connected again. Why try to fight something you can’t resist?","<p>The night continued with laughter, shared stories, and a few more drinks.

It seemed like she got more beautiful by the day. The glow from her pregnancy only enhanced it.  Keeping her eyes on the woman, Sophie waited until it was the right moment and grabbed her by the hand.

“Stealing the gorgeous host for a dance.” 

Sophie led them to the far edge of the floor.  Ryan shook her head but placed her arms around Sophie’s shoulders and allowed the woman to begin moving them to a slow rhythm.

“This DJ doesn’t seem that fond of slow music so I’m taking advantage of the moment.  Didn’t you notice?  He’s playing our song.”

Ryan listened and smiled. The DJ was playing The Point of it All by Anthony Hamilton. They swayed together as Sophie sung the lyrics in her ear.

“Have I told you how beautiful you look this evening, Mrs. Wilder-Moore?”

Sophie was lying on her couch, staring blankly at her laptop screen, losing track of how long she had been sitting motionless.




The crackle of a vinyl record playing in the background filled the room. It's one of the many records Ryan had borrowed (read: stole) from Jada's house during their visit the other week. Sophie had needed something—anything—that felt like a part of her girlfriend to be close to her right now. The night they first played this record was unforgettable.

""Uh oh.""




Ryan snickered, ""No, for real, let's take a listen with Gotham, and we'll come back to discuss it."" The engineer cued up the song, and the opening notes of ""Next Lifetime"" by Erykah Badu began to play.




""Uhhh, Ryan? Didn't this song come out over twenty-five years ago?""




""Yes, Sophie…just listen, and we'll be right back,"" Ryan said into the mic.




They went off the air as everyone in the studio listened to the track.

Ryan's mind zeroed into the woman sitting next to her. Lately, thoughts of her co-host crept in unprompted. Though they often butted heads, she's felt her heart do somersaults sometimes when Sophie was near.




Every time their eyes met, Ryan's pulse felt like it was going to shoot out of her skin. She noticed new details - the way she nibbled her pen when lost in thought or how she twitched her lip when she was feeling vulnerable. Ryan found it impossible to ignore the growing presence between them.




Yet she stalled to confront the meanings behind it all and decided instead to keep her cards close, though she wanted to play the song in an attempt to make sense of her muddled feelings.




Sophie noticed Ryan's pensive expression as they returned on-air. ""So, what made you choose that particular song for our listeners tonight?"" she asked.




""Well, I wanted to spark a discussion about relationships. That song makes me think about connections that feel...inexplicable.

"Ain't No Way","Aretha Franklin","","","","Aretha Franklin","Run to You ","Before getting started, Ryan grabbed her phone and turned on her ‘old skool’ playlist. A soft medley began playing as they each remained at their separate areas of the kitchen, both retreating into their heads. 

Smooth R&B was their background noise as they silently worked together, yet separately. Soft saxophone played as the Queen of Soul crooned.

Ain't no way for me to love you

If you won't let me

It ain't no way for me to give you all ya need

If you won't let me give all of me

The song was so fitting to their situation, Sophie actually stopped chopping as she listened to Aretha sing everything she was feeling.

Oh, but how can I, how can I, how can I

Give you all the things I can

If you're tying both of my hands?

Just the night before, Ryan had told Sophie that she was enough, but Sophie didn't know if she could trust her words when her actions stated differently. It seemed that every time they made headway in making their way back to one other, another obstacle appeared, knocking them off course. It hurt and Sophie didn't know how long she could continue on the roller coaster before needing to get off, permanently. 

And if you need me to love you

Say, say yeah you do

Oh then please, please, please

Don't you know that I need you?

Sophie had gone through the single most damaging experience of her life and she needed Ryan, but Ryan wasn't there, and she hadn't been there. Sophie felt so alone and all she wanted was her girlfriend’s support, but her girlfriend couldn't do that because of everything Sophie represented. And yes, Ryan had come to the Valley to see her, but was it too little too late? Were they too far gone to get what they had back? 

It ain't no way for me to love you

If you won't let me

All Sophie wanted to do was love Ryan. She'd wanted to believe that love was enough to guide them through the hard times, but if anything, this latest fiasco had shown her that love wasn't enough. 

“Soph?” 

Sophie looked up and over at Ryan as the song faded out. 

“Are you okay?” 

Sophie shook her head and was surprised when a tear fell down her cheek. She turned away from Ryan and quickly wiped it away.

Some were genuinely talented, others, well, they were certainly enthusiastic, even if their pitch was a bit off. She popped a fried pickle into her mouth as she thought to herself, 'There's no way in hell I'd ever be caught dead doing this.'

That thought lasted .8 seconds when suddenly, Anissa grabbed Ryan's hand, pulling her up from her seat. ""Come on, let's show 'em how it's done!"" she shouted, dragging Ryan towards the stage.

""What? No!""

""Come on - let's just have some fun, I put our names down earlier.""

Ryan's heart sank as she reluctantly followed, her feet heavy with each step. As they reached the stage, the opening notes of ""Knockin' Da Boots"" came through the speakers, ""This!!?"" Of all the songs Anissa could have picked, she chose this one?

Anissa grabbed the microphone and began belting out the provocative lyrics while Ryan stood awkwardly beside her, trying to blend into the background. But the other woman wasn't having it. She kept making eye contact, her gaze suggestive as she gyrated her hips in Ryan's direction.

Good lovin', body rockin' all night long, yeah

Makin' love until we tire to the break of dawn

But oh, come on, come on and turn the lights down,

and let me get on it, yeah'

Cause when I do, just me and you, it'll be so right

Ryan squirmed and glanced out at the audience, hoping for a sympathetic face. Instead, she was met with a sea of shocked expressions, mouths were wide open as they watched Anissa's performance. Yet, despite their surprise, they clapped along to the beat, some even whistling and cheering. Traitors.","<p>Ryan watched the performers on stage with amusement and secondhand embarrassment.

<p>Ryan's heart sank as she reluctantly followed, her feet heavy with each step. As they reached the stage, the opening notes of ""<strong>Knockin' Da Boots</strong>"" came through the speakers, ""This!!?"" Of all the songs Anissa could have picked, she chose this one?</p>
<p>Anissa grabbed the microphone and began belting out the provocative lyrics while Ryan stood awkwardly beside her, trying to blend into the background. But the other woman wasn't having it. She kept making eye contact, her gaze suggestive as she gyrated her hips in Ryan's direction.</p>
<p><strong><em>Good lovin', body rockin' all night long, yeah</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Makin' love until we tire to the break of dawn</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>But oh, come on, come on and turn the lights down,</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>and let me get on it, yeah'</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Cause when I do, just me and you, it'll be so right</em></strong></p>
<p>Ryan squirmed and glanced out at the audience, hoping for a sympathetic face. Instead, she was met with a sea of shocked expressions, mouths were wide open as they watched Anissa's performance. Yet, despite their surprise, they clapped along to the beat, some even whistling and cheering.&nbsp;<em>Traitors</em>.</p>","AdultishGambino","","AdultishGambino",5,"Knockin' da Boots by H-Town","The Moore You Know by AdultishGambino","<div><strong>Knockin' da Boots by H-Town</strong></div><div>The Moore You Know by AdultishGambino</div>",2024-03-21,"6x53SJOV1PAZ8ZUwH4NFXQ","6x53SJOV1PAZ8ZUwH4NFXQ?utm_source=generator",0,"https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d0000b273b5d10105224827001ededc04",0.726,0.501,1,-13.884,0,0.154,0.155,"Singing, Karaoke","https://archiveofourown.org/works/54069958/chapters/138423676","1993-01-28","<a href=""https://archiveofourown.org/works/54069958/chapters/138423676"" target=""_blank""

She took a step towards the stairs, ready to make a break for it. But just as she thought she was free, the music started up again with a new song. Anissa pulled her back, ""We're doing two songs tonight.""

""Two?!"" The people in the front of the stage broke out in laughter at her reaction, their amusement only adding to her growing irritation.

""Yeah, but I'll sing this one for you. Just stand right there.""

As the lyrics poured from Anissa's lips, Ryan felt like the song was a not-so-subtle message directed straight at her. The words spoke of desire, longing, and a yearning for something more—a sentiment that made her skin itch. It was clear that Anissa was trying to communicate her intentions, and Ryan wasn't sure how to respond to them.

Then I kissed your lips and you tuned on my fire, baby

And you burned me up within your flame

Took me a little higher

Made me live again, you turned on my fire, baby

Then you showed me what a love could do

Fire and desire, baby

Glancing out at the audience, Ryan's heart sank as she noticed the amount of camera phones pointed in their direction and she was pretty sure that several people were live-streaming the performance on Instagram. She frowned, realizing that this moment would be immortalized on social media, potentially reaching a far wider audience than she had anticipated.

The idea of her personal life being plastered all over the internet made her feel sick. She had always been careful to keep her private life separate from her public persona, but now it seemed that the two were colliding in the most uncomfortable way possible.

When the final notes of the song faded away, Ryan braced herself for the inevitable applause and the looks from the audience. She knew that this moment would be the talk of the town, and she dreaded the thought of facing the fallout. But for now, all she could do was put on a smile and hope that the night wouldn't get any worse.","<p>Her eyes then darted to the edge of the stage, calculating her escape.

...

“Why you wanna fly Blackbird, you ain’t ever gonna fly…”

Ryan Wilder sang quietly, shifting on the bench she was secured to in order to adjust the soft head in front of her. 

“…Why you wanna fly Blackbird…”

The song was theirs alone, one once chorused loudly in the humble apartment they called home in the inner-city Gotham neighbourhood of Brightcave Gardens.  

“… You ain’t ever gonna flyyy …”

Ryan thought of how at first, she resisted moving away from the war zone of the Wayside Heights projects she’d grown up in; and how she hated the little first-floor apartment, along with the woman who rented it. The home was too colourful, too clean, too calm; and the woman; too patient, too warm, too giving – everything Ryan hadn’t known she needed.

“… No place big enough for holding…”

Now, what she wouldn’t do to see the bright yellow walls and eccentric mismatched furniture and her adoptive mother singing badly as she cleaned all four rooms like a great palace. It hadn’t been much, nor had it been for long – just four short years – but Mama Cora made it a home for them to belong, and for a moment, Ryan had been still.

“…all the tears you're gonna cry...” 

Biting her lip, she quietened, expecting Cora to continue like she always did. However, no off-key notes came, only the reverberating siren of the ambulance they were in.

The only indication she was still alive was the tickling of jagged breaths over Ryan’s bare skin, and for that, she carried on.  

“…Cause your mama’s name was ‘Lonely’ –”

Yet, as she sang Cora’s part, something like a sob distorted the tune, and the woman that had become her mother in every sense of the word looked up with heartbreak etched across her swollen face.

The expression of worry was clearly for her and not Cora herself, and it reinforced every prior action that proved her love transcended the ties of blood. Ryan wanted to weep for it but sang instead.

“… And your daddy’s name was ‘Pain’…”

Wiping at the blood which intermittently dribbled out the corners of her normally smiling mouth; Ryan grew concerned that, like always, she was going to lose this beautiful thing because fairytale endings didn’t belong to orphans like her. Bellowing louder, she tried to quell such truths.

“…And they called you little sorrow ‘cause you'll never love again…”

Since they’d been jumped, the older woman had barely been able to follow conversation, panicking for the paralysis of her broken bones, and it was only when Ryan sang, did she calm into the half-way lucid state before her.

Despite the blaring siren and hectic speed of the ambulance, in the patient compartment, the atmosphere was tranquil, and a sinking feeling settled in the pit of her stomach. She wondered if the stillness she clung to for protection was the calm before the storm. 

It bewildered her to see her larger-than-life mother so small and fragile – words she’d never before associated with the boisterous nursing assistant.

“…So, why you wanna fly Blackbird –”

Seconds, minutes and hours seemed to have blurred into each other, and with Ryan’s head still ringing from the kicks she’d taken to the face, she wasn’t sure of how long it had been since she crawled to Cora’s bleeding side and pressed crimson fingers to 9-1-1. ","<p>Chapter Title: <strong>Blackbird</strong></p>

"Nunya","Kehlani","Dom Kennedy","","","Kehlani, Dom Kennedy","authenticity guaranteed","She grabbed her essentials before making her way to the bathroom. Half an hour later, Ryan stepped out of the shower freshly cleansed and feeling good. She smirked to herself in the mirror as she dried off before leaving the bathroom to go back to her room. She knew exactly how thin the walls were, and she hoped Kate enjoyed her concert, starting with Nunya by Kehlani featuring Dom Kennedy but without the Dom. Right after, she sang No One by Alicia Keys. She knew that combo had to get under Kate’s skin. She wondered how Kate felt about her rendition of My Girl by The Temptations as well as her bar for bar reciting of Shortie Like Mine by Bow Wow (the only song she didn’t skip parts of). Did that kind of song get under her skin more than the shots? Ryan sincerely hoped so because she couldn’t think of a lot of songs to throw shade so her concert included mostly whatever lovesick song came to mind first back to back, but she also threw in a hidden gem, a song called Late Night Drive by Yo Trane.

Ryan snickered quietly to herself at the memory of that reaction. She heard the front door loudly slam during the final chorus, and it took everything in her not to cackle during the rest of the song. She simply continued singing then moved on to the next and final love song until she was done. It would have been suspicious if she had stopped singing after Kate left, and she didn’t want Mary to be irritated at her pettiness.

Then again, Mary knew that Ryan didn’t normally sing love songs in the shower, so she was probably already on to her.","<p>She grabbed her essentials before making her way to the bathroom.

<p>Drawn by an invisible force, she began to move towards her. The woman turned, and their eyes locked in a strong stare. Their bodies naturally moved in sync as if they had been dancing together for years when the sexy song '<strong>Denovo</strong>' came on. Up close, she was even more stunning with her hair makeup, perfectly done hair, and her eyes blazing with a fire that made Sophie's breath catch in her throat and goosebumps race up her arms.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>She leaned in, her lips barely grazing the shell of the other's ear. ""You're a hard woman to find,"" she whispered, her voice merely audible over the music.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>""Maybe I didn&rsquo;t want to be found,"" the woman said with a teasing smile as she snaked her arms around Sophie's neck, erasing the distance between them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sophie's hands found her waist, fingers splaying over the curves and brown skin. The rhythmic swing of her hips and the brush of her thighs&mdash;all of it a heady mix of attraction and danger&mdash;made her head spin, clouding her judgment with every beat of the sensual bachata song.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They moved as one, spinning and twirling, their bodies molding together like two halves of a whole. The sexy woman rolled her ass against Sophie's, trailing her fingers down her arms.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sophie responded in kind, her hands roaming, mapping the outline of her back, dipping dangerously low. She spun her out, only to tug her back in, their faces just inches apart. Ryan's breath ghosted over her lips, a temptation begging to be tasted.</p>

She pulled me into a dance, with Louis Armstrong singing “What a Wonderful World.” “Not sure I like her,” she muttered.

“Freddie’s cool.”

“Just so long as she knows you’re mine.” She pressed her cheek to my temple and placed her hand within the cutout back of my dress, skin to skin. There was no way to doubt that I belonged to her when she was holding me like that.

I relished the opportunity to be so close to her scrumptious body in public. Breathing her in, I relaxed into her expert hold. “I like this.”

Sophie swept Ryan into her arms and began to sing the lyrics. Very few people outside of their family knew Sophie had an amazing voice.  It had been honed by years of singing in her mother’s church choir.  She had once hated her ability because it brought so many bad memories with it.  Now, it was something she enjoyed, especially for Ryan because Ryan loved to hear her.
